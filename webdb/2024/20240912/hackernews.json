7 days a week the new norm (for YC)?","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eI've worked for 2 major YC companies and done some one-off/contract work in recent years at a few others here in SF. Really like the startups coming out of YC.\u003cp\u003eI had to unfortunately voluntarily quit the last on-site contract due to it being 7 days a week (I tried to take off a Sunday, didn't work), on top of a requirement to be there until 8-9pm daily and occasionally pull all-nighters when there are sales demos (at the office until 7AM the next day - then stayed at work for the next day). I tried to stick it out, and even though I consider myself to have the best work ethic of anyone I know, being at an office nearly 24/7/365 to do basic React work with constantly changing directions/requirements felt pointless to say the least. It wasn't like we were building something with a clear goal in mind - and the founders did \u003ci\u003enothing\u003c/i\u003e. They would shoot hoops with the nerf basketball, leave for 2-3 hours at a time, come back with food, talk, etc.\u003cp\u003eAnyway, so I quit to find another gig, and in my first interview (YC company, just raised) the CEO says \"We work weekends, so it's 7 days a week, just want to make sure that's ok with you\".\u003cp\u003eSo my question to the YC community is:\u003cp\u003eIs this the new norm for YC startups?\u003cp\u003eYC founders who are requiring 24/7/365 work:\u003cp\u003eWhat do you feel you're getting out of it?

I can't actually access the system so I'm speaking from hearsay and what's information on public parts of their website. The way I understand it works is that you connect Pave to your HR and Payroll systems, they take the data about who you employ and how much you pay them, combine it with all their other companies, and give companies a collective breakdown of compensation ranges.\u003cp\u003eMy question is, isn't this specifically anti-competitive wage fixing?
