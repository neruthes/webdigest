Prize – a $1M+ competition towards open AGI progress","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHey folks! Mike here. Francois Chollet and I are launching ARC Prize, a public competition to beat and open-source the solution to the ARC-AGI eval.\u003cp\u003eARC-AGI is (to our knowledge) the only eval which measures AGI: a system that can efficiently acquire new skill and solve novel, open-ended problems. Most AI evals measure skill directly vs the acquisition of new skill.\u003cp\u003eFrancois created the eval in 2019, SOTA was 20% at inception, SOTA today is only 34%. Humans score 85-100%. 300 teams attempted ARC-AGI last year and several bigger labs have attempted it.\u003cp\u003eWhile most other skill-based evals have rapidly saturated to human-level, ARC-AGI was designed to resist “memorization” techniques (eg. LLMs)\u003cp\u003eSolving ARC-AGI tasks is quite easy for humans (even children) but impossible for modern AI. You can try ARC-AGI tasks yourself here: \u003ca href=\"https://arcprize.org/play\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://arcprize.org/play\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eARC-AGI consists of 400 public training tasks, 400 public test tasks, and 100 secret test tasks. Every task is novel. SOTA is measured against the secret test set which adds to the robustness of the eval.\u003cp\u003eSolving ARC-AGI tasks requires no world knowledge, no understanding of language. Instead each puzzle requires a small set of “core knowledge priors” (goal directedness, objectness, symmetry, rotation, etc.)\u003cp\u003eAt minimum, a solution to ARC-AGI opens up a completely new programming paradigm where programs can perfectly and reliably generalize from an arbitrary set of priors. At maximum, unlocks the tech tree towards AGI.\u003cp\u003eOur goal with this competition is:\u003cp\u003e1. Increase the number of researchers working on frontier AGI research (vs tinkering with LLMs). We need new ideas and the solution is likely to come from an outsider!\n2. Establish a popular, objective measure of AGI progress that the public can use to understand how close we are to AGI (or not). Every new SOTA score will be published here: \u003ca href=\"https://x.com/arcprize\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://x.com/arcprize\u003c/a\u003e\n3. Beat ARC-AGI and learn something new about the nature of intelligence.\u003cp\u003eHappy to answer questions!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca

HN: Revideo – Create Videos with Code","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHey HN! We’re building Revideo (\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/redotvideo/revideo\"\u003ehttps://github.com/redotvideo/revideo\u003c/a\u003e), an open source framework for programmatic video editing.\u003cp\u003eRevideo lets you create video templates in Typescript and render them with dynamic inputs through an API. It also comes with a \u003cPlayer /\u003e component that lets you preview your projects in the browser and integrate video editing functionality into web apps.\u003cp\u003eThe project is useful for anyone who wants to build apps that automate certain video editing tasks. A lot of companies in the space build their own custom stack for this, like Opus (\u003ca href=\"https://www.opus.pro/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.opus.pro/\u003c/a\u003e), which automatically creates highlight videos from podcasts, or Clueso (\u003ca href=\"https://www.clueso.io/\"\u003ehttps://www.clueso.io/\u003c/a\u003e), which lets you create stutter-free product walkthroughs with AI voiceovers.\u003cp\u003eRevideo is based on the HTML Canvas API and is forked from Motion Canvas (\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/motion-canvas/motion-canvas\"\u003ehttps://github.com/motion-canvas/motion-canvas\u003c/a\u003e), a tool that lets you create canvas animations. While Motion Canvas is intended by its maintainer to exclusively be a standalone application [1], we have turned Revideo into a library that developers can integrate into their apps, while specifically focusing on video use cases. To support this, we have, among other things, added the ability to do headless rendering, made video rendering much faster and added support for syncing and exporting audio.\u003cp\u003eWe’re excited about programmatic video editing because of the possibility to automate content creation with AI. One of our users is building StoriesByAngris (\u003ca href=\"https://storiesbyangris.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://storiesbyangris.com/\u003c/a\u003e), which lets you create video-based RPG stories from language prompts. Other users are marketing-tech companies that help their customers generate and A/B test different versions of video ads.\u003cp\u003eWe started to work on video tooling because we ourselves explored a bunch of product ideas in the space of AI-based video creation earlier this year. For example, we built apps that automatically create educational short videos and tinkered with apps that let you create memes.\u003cp\u003eWhile building these products, we were frustrated with the video editing frameworks we used: Moviepy (\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Zulko/moviepy\"\u003ehttps://github.com/Zulko/moviepy\u003c/a\u003e), which we used initially, doesn’t work in the browser, so we’d often have to wait minutes for a video to render just to test our code changes. Remotion (\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion\"\u003ehttps://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion\u003c/a\u003e), which we switched to later, is pretty good, but we didn’t want to rely on it as it is not FOSS (source-available only).\u003cp\u003eWe had already followed Motion Canvas for some time and really liked it, so we thought that extending it would get us to something useful much faster than building an animation library from scratch. We initially tried to build Revideo as a set of Motion Canvas plugins, but we soon realized that the changes we were making were too drastic and far too complex to fit into plugins. This is why we ultimately created a fork. We’re unsure if this is the right way to go in the long term, and would prefer to find a way to build Revideo without feeling like we’re dividing the community - if you have experience with this (keeping forks with complex changes in sync with upstream) or other suggestions on how to solve this, we’d love your input.\u003cp\u003eOur current focus is improving the open source project. In the long term, we want to make money by building a rendering service for developers building apps with Revideo.\u003cp\u003eWe’d love to hear your feedback and suggestions on what we can improve!
