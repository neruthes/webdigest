HN: Skyvern (YC S23) – open-source AI agent for browser automations","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHey HN, we’re Suchintan and Shu from Skyvern (\u003ca href=\"https://www.skyvern.com\"\u003ehttps://www.skyvern.com\u003c/a\u003e). We’re building an open source tool to help companies automate browser-based workflows using LLMs.\u003cp\u003eOur open source repo is at \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/Skyvern\"\u003ehttps://github.com/Skyvern-AI/Skyvern\u003c/a\u003e, and we're excited to share our cloud version with you (\u003ca href=\"https://app.skyvern.com\"\u003ehttps://app.skyvern.com\u003c/a\u003e) :)\u003cp\u003eSkyvern allows you to define a single (or a series of) goal-based prompts to instruct an agent to complete complex tasks on websites. Here’s a quick demo of Skyvern: \u003ca href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/76b231309df74a528061fcf102e1967f\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.loom.com/share/76b231309df74a528061fcf102e1967f\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe built this to solve a specific problem: building browser automations often requires companies to either hire people and scale out operations teams to do tedious manual work, or hire developers to use products like UI-Path or Selenium to build automations.\u003cp\u003eCode-based solutions always run into the same problem: they’re brittle (wow this website added a new pop-up dialog and my script broke), and fail to achieve the same objective across multiple websites (how can I fill out a contact-us form on hundreds of different websites?)\u003cp\u003eWe did a Show HN a few months ago (\u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39706004\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39706004\u003c/a\u003e), and \nsince then, we’ve onboarded customers for a wide variety of use cases: generating insurance quotes on websites like Geico.com; applying to jobs on websites like lever.co; automating filing permits in local government portals; registering new corporations for employment identification; fetching invoices from hundreds of different portals such as hydroone.com; automating purchasing on a handful of e-commerce websites like zooplus.com; and filling out contact us forms on a bunch of random smb websites (such as HVAC websites).\u003cp\u003eTo be able to service all of these, we’ve built and open-sourced quite a few interesting features:\u003cp\u003e(1) a fully-featured React application allowing you to see every action Skyvern is taking in real-time;\u003cp\u003e(2) livestreaming browser instances to allow our users to see what Skyvern is doing when running inside of a docker container;\u003cp\u003e(3) authenticated sessions, integrating with Bitwarden and allowing users to specify Email + Phone + QR-code based 2FAs;\u003cp\u003e(4) “workflows” allowing users to chain multiple goal-based prompts together, which can handle tasks like invoice downloading, or automating purchasing pipelines;\u003cp\u003e(5) processing HTML Elements (ex. identifying + summarizing SVGs) and performing website interactions (ex. Iterating over dynamic autocompletes to fill in address information correctly)\u003cp\u003e(6) “cached workflows”, allowing Skyvern to memorize previous interactions (ie text inputs) and re-use them in future runs.\u003cp\u003eWe’ve also been blessed with a few model advancements to solve some of the cost concerns the community brought up. Skyvern’s token costs went down 80% from $15 / 1M tokens (GPT-4V) to $2.50 / 1M tokens (GPT-4O)\u003cp\u003eDespite the model costs going down 80%, Skyvern is still quite expensive to run, so we give every new user $5 of credits to try it out and see if it can be useful for you.\u003cp\u003eWe would be honored if you could give it a try at \u003ca href=\"https://app.skyvern.com\"\u003ehttps://app.skyvern.com\u003c/a\u003e and share some feedback with us, and we look forward to any and all of your comments!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41936745\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41936745\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 217\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 51\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/Skyvern","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41936745","date_published":"2024-10-24T15:51:21Z","author":{"name":"suchintan","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=suchintan"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41936316","title":"Lost Silk Road Cities Discovered High in the Mountains of Central Asia","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/lost-silk-road-cities-discovered-high-in-the-mountains-of-central-asia/\"\u003ehttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/lost-silk-road-cities-discovered-high-in-the-mountains-of-central-asia/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41936316\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41936316\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 105\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 15\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/lost-silk-road-cities-discovered-high-in-the-mountains-of-central-asia/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41936316","date_published":"2024-10-24T15:12:34Z","author":{"name":"Brajeshwar","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Brajeshwar"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41936001","title":"Rider is now free for non-commercial use","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/\"\u003ehttps://www.jetbrains.com/rider/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41936001\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41936001\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 617\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 305\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41936001","date_published":"2024-10-24T14:43:26Z","author":{"name":"kretaceous","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kretaceous"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41935166","title":"Show HN: Which animal shares your body fat percentage?","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eI recently came across a youtube video about animals and their average body fat percentages.I thought it would be fun to compare my body fat to different animals and see which one I most resemble.

My name is Gabriele Cirulli, I’m the original creator of 2048. Ten years ago, someone posted 2048 on HN[1] and suddenly it seemed like everyone was playing it. Back then, I wrote a bit about my experience during those weeks[2].\u003cp\u003eEven after all these years, that experience still feels a bit surreal to me. I’m deeply grateful to everyone who connected with the game, whether in small or significant ways, and for the stories shared along the way. Some people expressed how they were going through tough times and found some comfort, however small, in playing 2048.\u003cp\u003eAt the start of last year, I wanted to breathe new life into the game as it was starting to show its age. I quit my job last October to work on 2048 full time and spent a year building this new version (the original took just 5 days!). I wanted to pay tribute to what made 2048 great while modernizing and polishing the experience.\u003cp\u003eThe idea of adding powerups came when Prime Gaming and I connected to see if we could create a special version of 2048 for their members, with some exclusive extras. Some of those powerups made it into the main game, though there’s still a Classic[3] mode just like the original for those who prefer a more hardcore experience. The old site is also still online[4].\u003cp\u003e2048 is now my full-time focus, and I’m excited about the ways it can keep improving. I wanted to share this update with the community where it all began, both for a bit of nostalgia and to hear your thoughts and feedback!\u003cp\u003eThank you all so much!\u003cp\u003e—
