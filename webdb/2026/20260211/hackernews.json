into what was actually happening on my wired and wireless networks.\u003cp\u003eI live in the CLI, but for discovery and ongoing monitoring, I kept bouncing between tools, terminals, and mental context switches. I wanted something faster and more visual, without losing technical depth — so I built a GUI that brings my favorite diagnostics together in one place.\u003cp\u003eAbout three months ago, I shared an early version here and got a ton of great feedback. I listened: a new name (it was PingStalker), a longer trial, and a lot of new features. Today I’m excited to share NetViews 2.3.\u003cp\u003eNetViews started because I wanted to know if something on the network was scanning my machine. Once I had that, I wanted quick access to core details—external IP, Wi-Fi data, and local topology. Then I wanted more: fast, reliable scans using ARP tables and ICMP.\u003cp\u003eAs a Wi-Fi engineer, I couldn’t stop there. I kept adding ways to surface what’s actually going on behind the scenes.\u003cp\u003eDiscovery \u0026 Scanning:\n* ARP, ICMP, mDNS, and DNS discovery to enumerate every device on your subnet (IP, MAC, vendor, open ports).\n* Fast scans using ARP tables first, then ICMP, to avoid the usual “nmap wait”.\u003cp\u003eWireless Visibility:\n* Detailed Wi-Fi connection performance and signal data.\n* Visual and audible tools to quickly locate the access point you’re associated with.\u003cp\u003eMonitoring \u0026 Timelines:\n* Connection and ping timelines over 1, 2, 4, or 8 hours.\n* Continuous “live ping” monitoring to visualize latency spikes, packet loss, and reconnects.\u003cp\u003eLow-level Traffic (but only what matters):\n* Live capture of DHCP, ARP, 802.1X, LLDP/CDP, ICMP, and off-subnet chatter.\n* mDNS decoded into human-readable output (this took months of deep dives).\u003cp\u003eUnder the hood, it’s written in Swift. It uses low-level BSD sockets for ICMP and ARP, Apple’s Network framework for interface enumeration, and selectively wraps existing command-line tools where they’re still the best option. The focus has been on speed and low overhead.\u003cp\u003eI’d love feedback from anyone who builds or uses network diagnostic tools:\n- Does this fill a gap you’ve personally hit on macOS?\n- Are there better approaches to scan speed or event visualization that you’ve used?\n- What diagnostics do you still find yourself dropping to the CLI for?\u003cp\u003eDetails and screenshots: \u003ca href=\"https://netviews.app\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://netviews.app\u003c/a\u003e\nThere’s a free trial and paid licenses; I’m funding development directly rather than ads or subscriptions. Licenses include free upgrades.\u003cp\u003eHappy to answer any technical questions about the implementation, Swift APIs, or macOS permission model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46955712\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46955712\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 151\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 43\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.netviews.app","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46955712","date_published":"2026-02-10T05:20:32Z","author":{"name":"n1sni","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=n1sni"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46955703","title":"AI doesn’t reduce work, it intensifies it","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eOriginal article: \u003ca href=\"https://hbr.org/2026/02/ai-doesnt-reduce-work-it-intensifies-it\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://hbr.org/2026/02/ai-doesnt-reduce-work-it-intensifies...\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46955703\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46955703\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 242\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 279\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/9/ai-intensifies-work/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46955703","date_published":"2026-02-10T05:19:00Z","author":{"name":"walterbell","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=walterbell"}}]}
