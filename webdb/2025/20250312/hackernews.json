I’m Cole Ashman, founder of Pila Energy. I’ve spent my career working on home energy systems—first as an engineer on Tesla’s Powerwall, where I focused on the Backup Gateway, Solar Inverter, and metering systems. More recently, I led Product at SPAN, where we built the Smart Electrical Panel and integrated with most major home solar, EV, and battery systems.\u003cp\u003ePila (\u003ca href=\"https://pila.energy/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://pila.energy/\u003c/a\u003e) is a home battery that plugs into a standard wall outlet, provides smart backup power, energy shifting, and grid services. It’s more than a power bank—it’s a distributed energy system that can scale across multiple rooms, entire buildings, and work together in real time as a coordinated system. We built Pila to be local first with an open API to allow developers to build use cases on top of our hardware (Home Assistant, etc).\u003cp\u003eBig batteries like Tesla Powerwall and Enphase are great if you own a home and can afford a $10K+ electrical project, but they require permanent installation, electricians, and panel upgrades—which makes them inaccessible for renters, apartments, and cost-conscious homeowners. Over 50% of the cost of installing a Powerwall isn’t even the battery itself—it’s soft costs: labor, permitting, etc. We wanted to create an entry point for more people to access energy security at home.\u003cp\u003eHow does it work?\u003cp\u003ePlug Pila into any 120V wall outlet, and power passes through to connected devices and appliances. The inverter, LFP battery, BMS, grid disconnection, controller, and wireless connectivity are all built in. (details at \u003ca href=\"https://pila.energy/tech-specs\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://pila.energy/tech-specs\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cp\u003eWhen an outage happens, the onboard inverter detects the power loss within 20ms and automatically disconnects from the grid (islanding). Whether you’re home or away, backup kicks in instantly. A built-in cellular radio ensures you get a notification even if your home WiFi is out. Pila is 1.6kWh. That will backup a standard fridge for over a day.\u003cp\u003eOne key challenge we faced with a distributed architecture was coordination between batteries, for things like solar-following and managing real-time draw from your utility connection. Unlike large garage systems, where you can run a wired CAN bus, our batteries are spread across the home. We’re solving this with a sub-GHz wireless mesh network—self-healing, coordinator-less, and designed to make setup and expansion as simple as plugging in another unit.\u003cp\u003eLong-term, we’d love to open up this protocol to provide a more reliable communication layer for energy products in noisy built environments—reducing reliance on consumer Wi-Fi.\u003cp\u003eWe want to deliver the value you’d expect from a whole-home battery like Powerwall, in a plug-in format. That means going beyond a basic lead acid UPS with real home energy management, useful insights about power use, power larger loads like sump pumps, and even deliver grid services.\u003cp\u003eMost portable batteries are missing the functionality that makes a home battery useful: no bidirectional power, no integration with solar or smart home systems, and no ability to manage home energy dynamically. They tend to be boxy, ruggedized, meant to be moved around, not seamlessly integrated into your living space. On top of that, many use e-mobility battery chemistries, which are great for delivering high power on demand but wear out faster when cycled daily for home energy use.\u003cp\u003eAs a renter myself, I started Pila because these awesome energy products aren’t accessible enough. And frankly, generators are loud, expensive, and a pain to deal with. Even many Powerwall owners I’ve talked to say they really care about keeping the fridge, WiFi, and a sump pump running—so why does energy resilience have to be so complicated and expensive?\u003cp\u003eAs the grid struggles to keep up with demand, we believe modular, renter-friendly batteries can make home energy resilience more accessible.\u003cp\u003eWhat's been your experience with home batteries? \nWhat recent power outages have you had, and how were you affected?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca

HN: Factorio Learning Environment – Agents Build Factories","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eI'm Jack, and I'm excited to share a project that has channeled my Factorio addiction recently: the Factorio Learning Environment (FLE).\u003cp\u003eFLE is an open-source framework for developing and evaluating LLM agents in Factorio. It provides a controlled environment where AI models can attempt complex automation, resource management, and optimisation tasks in a grounded world with meaningful constraints.\u003cp\u003eA critical advantage of Factorio as a benchmark is its unbounded nature. Unlike many evals that are quickly saturated by newer models, Factorio's geometric complexity scaling means it won't be \"solved\" in the next 6 months (or possibly even years). This allows us to meaningfully compare models by the order-of-magnitude of resources they can produce - creating a benchmark with longevity.\u003cp\u003eThe project began 18 months ago after years of playing Factorio, recognising its potential as an AI research testbed. A few months ago, our team (myself, Akbir, and Mart) came together to create a benchmark that tests agent capabilities in spatial reasoning and long-term planning.\u003cp\u003eTwo technical innovations drove this project forward: First, we discovered that piping Lua into the Factorio console over TCP enables running (almost) arbitrary code without directly modding the game. Second, we developed a first-class Python API that wraps these Lua programs to provide a clean, type-hinted interface for AI agents to interact with Factorio through familiar programming paradigms.\u003cp\u003eAgents interact with FLE through a REPL pattern:\n1. They observe the world (seeing the output of their last action)\n2. Generate Python code to perform their next action\n3. Receive detailed feedback (including exceptions and stdout)\u003cp\u003eWe provide two main evaluation settings:\n- Lab-play: 24 structured tasks with fixed resources\n- Open-play: An unbounded task of building the largest possible factory on a procedurally generated map\u003cp\u003eWe found that while LLMs show promising short-horizon skills, they struggle with spatial reasoning in constrained environments. They can discover basic automation strategies (like electric-powered drilling) but fail to achieve more complex automation (like electronic circuit manufacturing). Claude Sonnet 3.5 is currently the best model (by a significant margin).\u003cp\u003eThe code is available at \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/JackHopkins/factorio-learning-environment\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://github.com/JackHopkins/factorio-learning-environment\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cp\u003eYou'll need:\n- Factorio (version 1.1.110)\n- Docker\n- Python 3.10+\u003cp\u003eThe README contains detailed installation instructions and examples of how to run evaluations with different LLM agents.\u003cp\u003eWe would love to hear your thoughts and see what others can do with
