HN: Danswer (YC W24) – Open-source AI search and chat over private data","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHey HN! Chris and Yuhong here from Danswer (\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer\"\u003ehttps://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer\u003c/a\u003e). We’re building an open source and self-hostable ChatGPT-style system that can access your team’s unique knowledge by connecting to 25 of the most common workplace tools (Slack, Google Drive, Jira, etc.). You ask questions in natural language and get back answers based on your team’s documents. Where relevant, answers are backed by citations and links to the exact documents used to generate them.\u003cp\u003eQuick Demo: \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/hqSouur2FXw\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/hqSouur2FXw\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eOriginally Danswer was a side project motivated by a challenge we experienced at work. We noticed that as teams scale, finding the right information becomes more and more challenging. I recall being on call and helping a customer recover from a mission critical failure but the error was related to some obscure legacy feature I had never used. For most projects, a simple question to ChatGPT would have solved it; but in this moment, ChatGPT was completely clueless without additional context (which I also couldn’t find).\u003cp\u003eWe believe that within a few years, every org will be using team-specific knowledge assistants. We also understand that teams don’t want to tell us their secrets and not every team has the budget for yet another SaaS solution, so we open-sourced the project. It is just a set of containers that can be deployed on any cloud or on-premise. All of the data is processed and persisted on that same instance. Some teams have even opted to self-host open-source LLMs to truly airgap the system.\u003cp\u003eI also want to share a bit about the actual design of the system (\u003ca href=\"https://docs.danswer.dev/system_overview\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://docs.danswer.dev/system_overview\u003c/a\u003e). If you have questions about any parts of the flow such as the model choice, hyperparameters, prompting, etc. we’re happy to go into more depth in the comments.\u003cp\u003eThe system revolves around a custom Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline we’ve built. During indexing time (we pull documents from connected sources every 10 minutes), documents are chunked and indexed into hybrid keyword+vector indices (\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer/blob/main/backend/danswer/indexing/indexing_pipeline.py#L211\"\u003ehttps://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer/blob/main/backend/dans...\u003c/a\u003e).\u003cp\u003eFor the vector index (which gives the system the flexibility to understand natural language queries), we use state of the art prefix-aware embedding models trained with contrastive loss. Optionally the system can be configured to go over each doc with multiple passes of different granularity to capture wide context vs fine details. We also supplement the vector search with a keyword based BM25 index + N-Grams so that the system performs well even in low data domains. Additionally we’ve added in learning from feedback and time based decay—see our custom ranking function (\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer/blob/main/backend/danswer/document_index/vespa/app_config/schemas/danswer_chunk.sd#L187\"\u003ehttps://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer/blob/main/backend/dans...\u003c/a\u003e – this flexibility is why we love Vespa as a Vector DB).\u003cp\u003eAt query time, we preprocess the query with query-augmentation, contextual-rephrasing, as well as standard techniques like removing stopwords and lemmatization. Once the top documents are retrieved, we ask a smaller LLM to decide which of the chunks are “useful for answering the query” (this is something we haven’t seen much of elsewhere, but our tests have shown to be one of the biggest drivers for both precision and recall). Finally the most relevant passages are passed to the LLM along with the user query and chat history to produce the final answer. We post-process by checking guardrails and extracting citations to link the user to relevant documents. (\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer/blob/main/backend/danswer/prompts/chat_prompts.py#L20\"\u003ehttps://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer/blob/main/backend/dans...\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cp\u003eThe Vector and Keyword indices are both stored locally and the NLP models run on the same instance (we’ve chosen ones that can run without GPU). The only exception is that the default Generative model is OpenAI’s GPT, however this can also be swapped out (\u003ca href=\"https://docs.danswer.dev/gen_ai_configs/overview\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://docs.danswer.dev/gen_ai_configs/overview\u003c/a\u003e).\u003cp\u003eWe’ve seen teams use Danswer on problems like: Improving turnaround times for support by reducing time taken to find relevant documentation; Helping sales teams get customer context instantly by combing through calls and notes; Reducing lost engineering time from answering cross-team questions, building duplicate features due to inability to surface old tickets or code merges, and helping on-calls resolve critical issues faster by providing the complete history on an error in one place; Self-serving onboarding for new members who don’t know where to find information.\u003cp\u003eIf you’d like to play around with things locally, check out the quickstart guide here: \u003ca href=\"https://docs.danswer.dev/quickstart\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://docs.danswer.dev/quickstart\u003c/a\u003e.

You log in with your GitHub account.\u003cp\u003e2. You select the GitHub repo where your site/app is at (whether it's Next.js, 11ty, Hugo, Nuxt... as long as you're using flat files for content).\u003cp\u003e3. You add a single config file to your repo to define the content types and other settings (e.g. media folder).\u003cp\u003e4. Congrats: you now have a user friendly CMS to manage content + media BUT all changes are still tracked like regular commits (under your account) on GitHub.\u003cp\u003eI started using Jekyll around 2009 and over the course of the past 10+ years, I've helped build major sites and tiny blogs with Hugo, Gatsby, Next.js and more recently 11ty.\u003cp\u003eI still love it.\u003cp\u003eBUT once you're done building, managing content and media can be a bit of a pain. You have a few options:\u003cp\u003e- Edit files directly (on GitHub or your local). Good luck getting your colleagues on the marketing team to do that.\u003cp\u003e- Hook up a headless CMS like Contentful, Sanity, or Strapi. That works, but it's one more dependency and (IMHO) overkill in most cases.\u003cp\u003e- OR you could use something like [Decap CMS](\u003ca href=\"https://decapcms.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://decapcms.org/\u003c/a\u003e). Really cool project, but I've never been a fan of the UI/UX, and it's been a bit of a pain to setup (maybe that's just me).\u003cp\u003eI wanted something as simple as possible, preferably with nothing to install or deploy.\u003cp\u003eBack in 2018, I had built a prototype (Jekyll+) [1] with the idea of getting a CMS set up by just adding a single configuration file to your GitHub repository.\u003cp\u003ePages CMS [2] is a continuation of that idea. It's 100% free and Open Source:  \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/pages-cms/pages-cms\"\u003ehttps://github.com/pages-cms/pages-cms\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cp\u003eIf you don't want to use the online version because you're not comfortable signing up with your GitHub account, consider the following options:\u003cp\u003e- Use a fine-grained personal access token [3], there's an option on the login screen. There is still a bug if you try to access a repo that isn't part of your token scope, but I'll get it fixed in the next couple of days.\u003cp\u003e- Deploy it yourself (for free) on Cloudflare Pages. Literally 5 minutes of work max. I made a video walking you through the process [4].\u003cp\u003e- Check out the intro video on the front page [2] (a bit crap, but I'll get a better one up in the next few days).\u003cp\u003eI use it actively with a few other teams, I hope it will be of use to some of you.\u003cp\u003eI'm already working on adding a few nicer features, like collaborative editing and email invites (to let non-developers login without a GitHub account).\u003cp\u003ePS: I've spent the past 8+ years building a business and only recently got back into coding. I'd love pointers as to what I could do better (and how I can manage my Powerpoint PTSD).\u003cp\u003e[1]: \u003ca
