(AP Photo/Eraldo Peres, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>Enraged protesters broke into government buildings that are the very symbol of their country’s democracy. Driven by conspiracy theories about their candidate's loss in the last election, they smashed windows, sifted through the desks of lawmakers and trashed the highest offices in the land in a rampage that lasted hours before order could be restored.</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-jair-bolsonaro-politics-brazil-government-8766c0ad2fcc4ae7c8bf1aa7f9aaa0ec">Sunday's attack</a> by supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil's capital drew immediate parallels with the <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/capitol-siege">Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol</a> by former President Donald Trump's backers two years and two days earlier. </p><p>The two populist former presidents shared a close political alliance with an overlapping cast of supporters — some of whom helped spread <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-michael-pence-electoral-college-elections-health-2d9bd47a8bd3561682ac46c6b3873a10">Trump's lies</a> about <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-claims-biden-won-explained-bd53b14ce871412b462cb3fe2c563f18">losing his re-election</a> due to voter fraud and later parroted Bolsonaro's similar claims after his own re-election loss last fall. Bolsonaro was among the last world leaders to recognize Joe Biden's victory in 2020.</p><p>“The U.S. example of election denying and creating alternative facts, and radicalizing law enforcement, and of openly disparaging democratic institutions was a template that I don’t think Bolsonaro et al would have come up with on their own,” said Scott Hamilton, a former U.S. diplomat in Brazil.</p><div id="afs:Card:272901778982" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="22a083f0d08bb9d1d93b67871a103b0c">Hub peek embed (JairBolsonaro) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Still, experts warn against conflating the two attacks.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>There were “undeniable similarities” to Jan. 6, said Graham Brookie, senior director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensics Research Lab, which tracks disinformation around the globe.</p><p>“The imagery. A lot of the calls for action on social media are very, very similar,” he said. “But there’s a huge caveat. Democracy in Brazil is a lot different than democracy here in the United States. The culture, the context, even the institutions are really different, and that really matters.”</p><p>Many of the connections are out in the open. Bolsonaro’s lawmaker son, Eduardo, in 2019 signed on to work with Trump adviser Steve Bannon’s international populist movement. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-steve-bannon-congress-donald-trump-sentencing-36d412eba9e1609a030859852378ae3d">Bannon</a> became one of the loudest proponents of Trump's election lies in 2020 and has amplified Bolsonaro's claims about rigged voting machines.</p><p>Trump was one of Bolsonaro’s few foreign allies, and Bolsonaro often exalted his American counterpart’s leadership, even posting photos of himself watching Trump’s addresses. He and his son visited Trump at Mar-a-Lago, and both attended dinners at Bannon's house.</p><p>After Sunday's rioting in Brasilia, Bannon called the protesters “Brazilian freedom fighters” in a video on social media.</p><p>The Conservative Political Action Conference, a key gathering of right-wing activists that has been a hotbed of pro-Trump enthusiasm, met in Sao Paulo in September. One of the attendees, former Trump spokesman Jason Miller, was later detained by Brazilian authorities before leaving the country.</p><p>"We do not advocate violence but believe peaceful protests are proper and that the situation in Brazil should be fully investigated,” Matt Schlapp, CPAC’s lead organizer, said in a statement to The Associated Press in reaction to the weekend rioting.</p><p>Protesters stormed Brazil's Congress, Supreme Court and presidential palace, with some calling for the military to oust President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Others waved banners suggesting they believed claims that voting machines were programmed to steal the election from Bolsonaro, reminiscent of signs brandished on Jan. 6 promoting similar conspiracy theories in the U.S.</p><p>The images of Brazilian protesters fighting with police guarding the complex, breaking into government offices and searching the desks of opposition lawmakers added to the flashbacks about the attack on the U.S. Capitol.</p><p>The attacks followed months of Bolsonaro <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-elections-caribbean-voting-brazil-8acf78e1e58650424b1dec4ecfc35ce4">exploiting fears about election integrity</a> without offering evidence, similar to Trump in 2020. </p><p>In November, Bolsonaro <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-caribbean-brazil-c03ec4f0e1d65fc81c02a2d90181cf48">blamed his loss on a software bug</a> and called for most electronic votes to be annulled. Independent experts rejected his claim, and Bolsonaro’s bid to annul the votes failed.</p><p>Social media still throbbed with misinformation about the election after it ended, and posts urging Brazilians to converge on their capital city on Sunday to challenge the election results went viral on TikTok, Facebook, Telegram and other platforms. One post racked up more than 800,000 views just since Friday, according to an analysis by Aos Fatos, a Brazilian fact-checking organization.</p><p>Wendy Via, president of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, said Sunday’s riots are yet another example of how online misinformation and rhetoric can spur violence if they’re deployed by a leader with a large enough audience.</p><p>“We did see this coming,” Via said. “This doesn’t just happen in Brazil, or the United States. This is a global problem. Should we compare what happened in Brazil to Jan. 6? I say 100%, because it’s the same playbook.”</p><p>But there are important differences between the two attacks and the forces in the two countries that propelled them. </p><p>“This was not part of an orchestrated movement to overturn the election results,” said Christopher Garman, managing director of the Americas for the Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting group. “It's a little bit of a different animal” than Jan. 6, he said. </p><p>On Jan. 6, 2021, Trump was still president, and he urged his supporters at his rally on the ellipse to march to the Capitol and stop Congress' ratification of Joe Biden's victory. In Brasilia, the protest occurred on a Sunday, when few were in government offices and Bolsonaro had already relinquished power.</p><p>Bolsonaro <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-florida-state-government-brazil-099db80c6511119b534ca17747f871fe?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=TopNews&amp;utm_campaign=position_05">had even left the country</a> — to Trump's adopted home state of Florida, where he appears to have been staying in the Orlando area. On Monday, he checked into a hospital there, complaining of abdominal pains.</p><p>Garman said Bolsonaro's hand may have been checked by Brazil's supreme court, which has been aggressively penalizing misinformation about the election to the point of censoring social media accounts and news reports that it found misleading. Bolsonaro knew that if he pushed too hard, the court could rule he could not run for public office again.</p><p>“If he had followed the Trump path, his political rights would have already been suspended,” Garman said.</p><p>The situation in Brazil is also more fraught than in the U.S. Systemic corruption is a greater concern in that country, as is the stability of what is still a fairly young democracy after decades of authoritarian rule that lasted through the 1980s. The man who beat Bolsonaro, Lula, is a former president who was imprisoned on corruption charges during Bolsonaro's initial 2018 election, only to have his conviction annulled by Brazil's supreme court.</p><p>The anti-establishment anger may sound familiar to those who follow U.S. politics — a hyper-polarized political environment and a weakened center, along with mounting distrust in both institutions and those on the other side.</p><p>“It's not healthy for any democracy to have these levels of distrust,” Garman said.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers David Biller in Rio de Janeiro and Joshua Goodman in Miami contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

The documents were found on Nov. 2, 2022, in a “locked closet” in the office, Sauber said.</p><p>Sauber said the attorneys immediately alerted the White House Counsel's office, who notified the National Archives and Records Administration — which took custody of the documents the next day. </p><p>“Since that discovery, the President’s personal attorneys have cooperated with the Archives and the Department of Justice in a process to ensure that any Obama-Biden Administration records are appropriately in the possession of the Archives,” Sauber said. </p><p>A person who is familiar with the matter but not authorized to discuss it publicly said Attorney General Merrick Garland asked U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois John Lausch to review the matter after the Archives referred the issue to the department. John Lausch was appointed to his post by former President Donald Trump.</p><div id="afs:Card:130243251955" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="812ef44a5333f6d93423a67a683fa024">Hub peek embed (JoeBiden) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The National Archives did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. A message seeking comment from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Chicago wasn’t immediately returned Monday.</p><p>CBS was first to report on the discovery of the potentially classified documents.</p><p>The Justice Department for months has been investigating the retention of roughly 300 documents that were marked as classified and were recovered from the <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/mar-a-lago">Florida estate of former President Donald Trump.</a> In that instance, prosecutors say, representatives of Trump resisted requests to give back the full stash of classified documents and failed to fully comply with a subpoena that sought their return.</p><p>FBI agents in August served a search warrant at the Mar-a-Lago property, removing 15 boxes of records.</p><p>That investigation is being led by special counsel Jack Smith. Prosecutors have interviewed an array of Trump associates and have been using a grand jury to hear evidence.</p><p>It is not clear when a decision when will be made on whether Trump, or anyone else, should be charged.</p><p>—</p><p>Associated Press writers Eric Tucker and Farnoush Amiri in Washington and Michael Tarm in Chicago contributed.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Electing the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-house-of-representatives-kevin-mccarthy-us-republican-party-0938c7358f41c83759246f8949ac7c15?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=TopNews&amp;utm_campaign=position_01">House speaker</a> may have been the easy part. Now House Republicans will try to govern.</p><p>Speaker <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/kevin-mccarthy">Kevin McCarthy</a> faces his first test late Monday as the Republicans try to approve their <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-us-republican-party-office-of-congressional-ethics-pandemics-60b4f098523b982b549823f4b3e8f9e4">rules package</a> for governing House operations, typically a routine step on Day One that is now stretching into the second week of the new majority.</p><p>After that, the House Republicans will try later Monday to pass their first bill — legislation to cut funding that is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-ap-fact-check-congress-government-and-politics-11eae023a3dc3a04584371843234cab7">supposed to bolster the Internal Revenue Service</a>. The Republicans' IRS bill ran into a snag ahead of votes because the budget office announced that rather than save money, it would add $114 billion to the federal deficit.</p><p>It’s the start of a new era of potentially crisis governing, House Republicans lurching from one standoff to the next, that shows <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-house-of-representatives-kevin-mccarthy-government-e986c620149b72030bb418bd5fadb4a2">the challenges McCarthy confronts</a> in leading a rebellious majority as well as the limits of President Joe Biden's remaining agenda on Capitol Hill.</p><p>With sky-high ambitions for a hard-right conservative agenda but only a narrow hold on the majority, which enables just a few holdouts to halt proceedings, the Republicans are rushing headlong into an uncertain, volatile start of the new session. They want to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-inflation-donald-trump-business-9af868065b776b21f81fa73e7bafb97d">investigate Biden</a>, slash federal spending and beef up competition with China. </p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="b9fcfd11427a695fe2eb49e36988f1a0">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>But first McCarthy, backed by former President Donald Trump, will try will show the Republican majority can keep up with basics of governing.</p><p>“You know, it’s a little more difficult when you go into a majority and maybe the margins aren’t high,” McCarthy acknowledged after winning the speaker's vote. “Having the disruption now really built the trust with one another and learned how to work together.”</p><p>As McCarthy gaveled open the House on Monday as the new speaker, the Republicans were set to consider the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-us-republican-party-office-of-congressional-ethics-pandemics-60b4f098523b982b549823f4b3e8f9e4">Rules package,</a> a hard-fought 55-page document that McCarthy negotiated with conservative holdouts to win over their votes to make him House speaker.</p><p>Central to the package is the provision the conservative Freedom Caucus wanted that reinstates a longstanding rule that allows any one lawmaker make a motion to “vacate the chair” — a vote to oust the speaker. Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi had done away with the rule when Democrats took charge in 2019 because conservatives had held it over past Republican speakers as a threat.</p><p>Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Va., said the rules are about “getting back to the basics.”</p><p>But that's not the only change. There are other provisions the conservatives extracted from McCarthy that weaken the power of the speaker's office and turn over more control of the legislative business to rank-and-file lawmakers, particularly those far-right lawmakers who won concessions.</p><p>The Republicans are allowing more Freedom Caucus lawmakers on the Rules committee that shapes legislative debates. Those members promise more open and free-flowing debates and are insisting on 72 hours to read legislation ahead of votes. </p><p>But it's an open debate if the changes will make the House more transparent in its operations or grind it to a halt, as happened last week when McCarthy battled through four days and 14 failed ballots before finally winning the speaker's gavel.</p><p>Many Republicans defended the standoff over the speaker's gavel, which was finally resolved in the post-midnight hours of Saturday morning on the narrowest of votes — one of the longest speaker's race showdowns in U.S. history.</p><p>“A little temporary conflict is necessary in this town in order to stop this town from rolling over the American people,” Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said over the weekend on CNN. </p><p>On Monday, Roy praised the new rules, saying he could file a motion “right now” to demand a vote on the speaker — as it has been through much of House history.</p><p>But heading into Monday evening's voting on the rules package, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-kevin-mccarthy-house-of-representatives-4922d22689eb79d5d05c1b49ca733123?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=TopNews&amp;utm_campaign=position_06">at least two other Republicans</a> raised objections about the backroom deals McCarthy had cut, leaving it unclear if there would be enough GOP support for passage as all Democrats are expected to be opposed.</p><p>Democrats decried the new rules as caving to the demands of the far-right aligned with Trump's Make American Great Again agenda.</p><p>“These rules are not a serious attempt at governing,” said Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Rules Committee. Rather, he said, it's a “ransom note from far right.”</p><p>Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., focused his criticism on the GOP's so-called Holman Rule, which would allow Congress to rescind the pay of individual federal employees: “This is no way to govern."</p><p>McCarthy commands a slim 222-seat Republican majority, which means on any given vote he can only lose four GOP detractors or the legislation will fail, if all Democrats are opposed. </p><p>The new rules are making McCarthy's job even tougher. For example, Republicans are doing away with the proxy voting that Democrats under former Speaker Nancy Pelosi put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. That means McCarthy must demand greater attendance and participation on every vote with almost no absences allowed for family emergencies or other circumstances.</p><p>“Members of Congress have to show up and work again,” said Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La.</p><p>With the Senate still narrowly held by Democrats, the divided Congress could still be a time of bipartisan deal-making. Monday saw a group of Republican and Democratic senators head to the southern U.S. border with Mexico as they try to develop an immigration overhaul to curb the flow of migrants. </p><p>But more often a split Congress produces gridlock.</p><p>The Republicans have been here before, just over a decade ago, when the tea party class swept to the majority in 2011, booting Pelosi from the speaker's office and rushing into an era of hardball politics that shut down the government and threatened a federal debt default.</p><p>McCarthy was a key player in those battles, having recruited the tea party class when he was the House GOP's campaign chairman. He tried and failed to take over for Republican John Boehner in 2015 when the beleaguered House speaker abruptly retired rather than face a potential vote by conservatives on his ouster. </p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Kevin Freking and Hope Yen contributed to this report. </p>]]></description>

And any time they do vote, they will have to do so in person — no more voting by proxy from home.</p><p>Those are just some of the changes being made by the now <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-kevin-mccarthy-house-of-representatives-4922d22689eb79d5d05c1b49ca733123">GOP-led House</a> that has chafed at some of the restrictions Democrats put in place as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Jan. 6 insurrection.</p><p>A look at some of the key changes Republicans are expected to adopt Monday that will affect floor proceedings and dictate their priorities in the 118th Congress.</p><p>ENDING PROXY VOTING</p><p>As the pandemic surged in the U.S. and the death toll reached more than 80,000, the House <a href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-donald-trump-politics-f6081d31f1e6e7ca5f541df51787a491">approved new rules</a> allowing lawmakers to vote by proxy. Under the process, they assigned their vote to another lawmaker who then announced on the House floor how the absent lawmaker was voting on a particular bill.</p><p>Republicans <a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-health-business-congress-voting-414cb594073bab735552c6918c308470">opposed the change</a> from the start, though many used proxy voting after it went into effect. And hewing to their campaign promise, they made sure the House rules provide no option for remote voting.</p><p>Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., the House majority leader, said that ending proxy voting would increase collaboration and speed up the voting process.</p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="60b4f098523b982b549823f4b3e8f9e4">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“It’s about making Congress work again where people have to show up and do their jobs in person like everybody else in the real world has to,” Scalise said.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>PRESSURE ON THE SPEAKER</p><p>House rules give lawmakers the ability to remove the speaker from the job through what's known as a motion to vacate. A majority vote of all House members would be needed for the speaker to be ousted.</p><p>House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., hoping to appease some on the hard right, agreed to give as few as five Republican members the ability to initiate a vote to remove him. But when that wasn't good enough for some of the more conservative members of the conference, he agreed to reduce that threshold to one — the threshold that historically has been the norm.</p><p>Proponents of the one-person threshold said it promotes accountability, noting its long history in the House. The last use of the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/eeb516db1105468896641ef0cda238a9">motion was in 2015</a>, when then-Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, a Republican who later became Donald Trump's chief of staff, introduced a resolution to declare the speaker's office vacant. Two months later, Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said he would be stepping down.</p><p>Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., calls the move to go back to the lower threshold “allowing the far-right to hold the incoming speaker hostage." And some moderate Republicans agree with that assessment.</p><p>But Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., who initially opposed McCarthy's speakership bid before ultimately supporting him, said the bare-minimum threshold had been in place since the 1800s and is an important tool that was in force until House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took the gavel.</p><p>“In the business arena, if a CEO is not doing the job, you get fired," Norman said. “Same thing in politics. We're not immune." </p><p>REVAMPING ETHICS OFFICE</p><p>Republicans are proposing major changes to the Office of Congressional Ethics, which initiates reviews of ethics complaints and when appropriate refers its findings to the House Committee on Ethics. Only the latter has the authority to recommend discipline.</p><p>But the office initiating the review plays a critical role in ensuring complaints from the public are followed up on. The board has six members and two alternates.</p><p>The Republican rules package would essentially gut the office, according to advocacy groups opposing the changes being made.</p><p>First, the new rules force three of the four Democrats who currently sit on the eight-member board to leave their positions immediately because they would be serving beyond an eight-year term limit that the rules package imposes. Second, it requires OCE staff to have been hired within 30 days of the rule's passage, making it difficult to assess and hire candidates for those jobs in such a brief window.</p><p>“Together, these changes weaken OCE to the point where the office would struggle to perform its core function, dismantling one of the only ways members of Congress are head accountable for ethics violations," said the Campaign Legal Center, which led a letter to lawmakers on behalf of about two dozen advocacy groups.</p><p>Members of both parties have chafed at the OCE's work over the years, complaining that complaints to the office are often politically motivated. The rule also directs the Ethics Committee to come up with a process to receive complaints directly from the public, rather than go through the OCE.</p><p>THE HOLMAN RULE</p><p>Another rule Republicans are resurrecting allows lawmakers to include language in appropriations bills that can rearrange an agency or slash specific positions or salaries.</p><p>Republicans say the rule is about enhancing accountability. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Va., said the rule was created in 1876 as a tool to cut spending by restructuring an agency. <a href="https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1851-1900/The-Holman-Rule/">Rep. William Holman thought spending</a> was out of control, Griffith said.</p><p>But the rule could also be used to target an individual over ideological differences, or say a special counsel, like the one overseeing the Justice Department’s investigation into the presence of classified documents at former President Donald Trump’s Florida estate. Of course, the Democratic-led Senate would have to go along for any such rescissions to take effect, which is highly unlikely. </p><p>The House Freedom Caucus even specifically named Dr. Anthony Fauci in calling for the rule's reinstatement. Fauci served as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases from 1984 to 2022, and his efforts to mitigate the damage from COVID-19 clashed with the views of some conservatives closely aligned with former President Donald Trump. </p><p>FIRE UP THE INVESTIGATIONS</p><p>The rules package calls for the House to vote on a resolution establishing a committee to investigate a number of things involving “strategic competition" between the U.S. and China as lawmakers take a more hardline approach with the Asian nation. </p><p>It also calls for creation of a “select subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal government" to be within the Judiciary Committee, which is headed by Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a hardliner who is a close ally of Trump.</p><p>“We’re going to get into what’s going on at the FBI where we have had 14 whistleblowers come talk to us about the weaponization of government there and the political nature of the Justice Department," Jordan said on “Fox News Sunday.”</p><p>Votes on creating those committees could come as soon as this week.</p><p>Democrats call the “weaponization" panel a ploy to push a far-right agenda.</p><p>“In my mind, it speaks volumes that they are choosing to prioritize this kind of dangerous partisan garbage instead of actually trying to help the American people," McGovern said.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — An estimated $1.1 billion Mega Millions jackpot drawing Tuesday night has people lined up at convenience stores nationwide to buy tickets in longshot hopes of winning a massive prize, but shop and gas station owners selling the tickets also have a chance at a big-figure bonus.</p><p>State lotteries usually reward the owners of business that sell winning jackpot tickets thousands of dollars or even up to $1 million, even before those giant prizes are claimed.</p><p>FIRST THINGS FIRST, WHAT’S THE LATEST ON THE JACKPOT?</p><p>It seems no one can win the Mega Millions jackpot, so it keeps getting larger. The last time someone overcame the odds of 1 in 302.6 million and won the top prize was on Oct. 14. Since then there have been 24 straight drawings without anyone snagging the jackpot. The prize now <a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-lotteries-490f479fa200c10ceb97547b648f9483">ranks as the fifth-largest</a>, though it’s still only about half the size of a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lotteries-iowa-36ef3aefbbc37a15e1c5f172129fa6a6">record $2.04 billion Powerball jackpot</a>, won only a couple months ago by someone in California.</p><p>While it seems like forever since someone won, it's quite a ways from the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/iowa-6bdd1553e09dd6b8bb947b5a37e4c8fc">record of 41 straight drawings</a> that has occurred a couple of times, most recently leading up to that $2.04 billion California prize.</p><p>AND WHO IS THE LUCKY CALIFORNIAN?</p><div id="afs:Card:604728406135" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="cf5a7fc41ee94466bbe5894e1ec48615">Hub peek embed (apf-business) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>That remains a mystery. The California Lottery hasn’t announced a winner and says its policy is to not acknowledge whether anyone has claimed a prize until a supposedly winning ticket is vetted. All that’s clear is that a ticket matching all six numbers drawn Nov. 9 was sold at Joe’s Service Center in Altadena, an unincorporated community northeast of Los Angeles.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>ONE WINNER IN ALTADENA IS CLEAR.</p><p>Even if we don’t know anything about the Powerball winner, we know the service center owner, Joe Chahayed, was paid his $1 million bonus by lottery officials. Standing under a sign hoisted by the lottery that read, Billionaire Made Here, and surrounded by dozens of media representatives and well-wishers, Chahayed said he planned to spend the money on his five children and would donate some of it to help his community. He didn’t have a clue who had purchased the winning ticket.</p><p>“I wish I knew the person but most people who buy tickets from me are from the neighborhood. I hope one of them will be the winner,” he said.</p><p>HOW DOES THE RETAILER BONUS SYSTEM WORK?</p><p>The rules vary from state to state. Ohio, for example, pays up to $100,000 to retailers who sell jackpot-winning tickets. In Illinois, retailers can get up to a $500,000 bonus and in California, that benefit tops out at $1 million. The state lotteries say it's part of their efforts to encourage retailers to promote ticket sales. Some business owners say they also often see at least a temporary surge in business, as superstitious players stop off to buy their tickets at a spot where someone hit it big.</p><p>POWERBALL GETTING LARGER, TOO</p><p>Even as the Mega Millions jackpot grows ever larger, the top prize for the Powerball game is also nearing massive status. Ahead of a drawing Monday night, that prize stands at $340 million for players who opt to be paid through an annuity, doled out over 29 years.</p><p>IF YOU BUY A TICKET, DON’T FORGET ... </p><p>Whether you spend $2 or $200 on Mega Millions or Powerball tickets, your chance of winning are incredibly small. Powerball's odds of 1 in 292.2 million are a little better than those offered by Mega Millions, but they're still miserable. Can't get your mind around that? Andrew Swift, a mathematics professor at the University of Nebraska-Omaha, described it another way, noting the odds of winning for a person who buys a single ticket in either game are a little worse than flipping a coin and getting heads 28 straight times. </p><p>AND DON’T FORGET THIS, EITHER</p><p>Although the publicized annuity prize of $1.1 billion for winning Mega Millions or $340 million for Powerball jackpot get all the attention, winners rarely choose <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-iowa-e9446d1c0cded3f86348db3df374e7f6">such a long-term payment option</a>. They want their money right now. The cash payout is much smaller, at $568.7 million for Mega Millions and $178.2 million for Powerball.</p><p>So as you dream of buying a yacht, maybe for settle for just one rather than two.</p><p>Mega Millions is played in 45 states as well as Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>]]></description>

(Jan. 9)</p>    <p>ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — Bills safety Damar Hamlin said he returned to Buffalo on Monday “with a lot of love on my heart” to continue his recovery in a hospital there, a week after <a href="https://apnews.com/article/Bills-damar-hamlin-collapse-what-happened-d73a76f2f7f736b652e95896dfaa0900">going into cardiac arrest and having to be resuscitated</a> on the field during a game in Cincinnati.</p><p>Hamlin was discharged from the University of Cincinnati Medical Center in the morning and flown to western New York. He was listed in stable condition at Buffalo General Medical Center/Gates Vascular Institute.</p><p>“I can confirm that he is doing well. And this is the beginning of the next stage of his recovery,” said Dr. William Knight, one of his doctors in Cincinnati.</p><p>Doctors said Hamlin has been walking since having a breathing tube removed on Friday, eating regular food and undergoing therapy. They said he was on a normal or even accelerated trajectory in his recovery from cardiac arrest, which is considered a life-threatening event, and that normal recovery can be measured from weeks to months.</p><p>“We continue to be ecstatic about his recovery,” Dr. Timothy Pritts said.</p><p>Hamlin’s return comes a day after he cheered on the Bills from his hospital bed during their regular season-ending <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-england-patriots-buffalo-bills-miami-dolphins-york-jets-nfl-25243cdf2ceb3780419859fc39537ef4">35-23 win</a> over the New England Patriots. The game proved to be a cathartic outpouring of support for the Bills and Hamlin.</p><div id="afs:Card:234821764243" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="35005f5e4ac87eca56e7d99d49eaec65">Hub peek embed (NFL) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“Headed home to Buffalo today with a lot of love on my heart,” Hamlin said in a tweet. “Watching the world come together around me on Sunday was truly an amazing feeling.” </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Hamlin was so excited watching teammate Nyheim Hines return the opening kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown that "he jumped up and down, got out of his chair, set every alarm off in the ICU in the process," Pritts said with a laugh. “But he was fine. It was just appropriate reaction to very exciting play.”</p><p>Pritts said it was still premature to comment on the potential cause of Hamlin’s cardiac arrest and that more testing would be done.</p><p>“The goal of the transfer .... is to get him closer to home for further evaluation, recovery and eventually discharge and rehabilitation,” Buffalo General Medical Center/Gates Vascular Institute said in a news release.</p><div id="1671a3ce8f694de18a3d181c6bb9d600" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>The Bills wore No. 3 Hamlin patches on their jerseys Sunday and honored their teammate by raising three fingers in the closing minutes, while tight end Dawson Knox celebrated his touchdown by forming his hands into the shape of a heart. Fans joined in, with many holding up red heart and No. 3 signs.</p><p>“The same love you all have shown me is the same love that I plan to put back into the world n more,” Hamlin tweeted Monday.</p><p>Bills coach Sean McDermott and general manager Brandon Beane briefly saw Hamlin after he landed in Buffalo.</p><p>“We’re happy to have him back.” McDermott told reporters on a conference call. “He’s a little bit tired, but it was good to get to see him in person for the first time in a while."</p><p>The 24-year-old from the Pittsburgh area has made significant progress in his recovery since spending his first two days at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center under sedation and breathing through a ventilator.</p><p>He was awakened on Wednesday night and was eventually able to grip people’s hands. By Friday, Hamlin was able to breathe on his own and even addressed the team by videoconference, telling the Bills, “Love you boys.”</p><p>The last update from doctors came on Saturday, when they described Hamlin’s neurological function as “excellent,” though he remained listed in critical condition. </p><p>Pritts said doctors were able to upgrade his condition from critical on Monday, clearing the way for the flight home.</p><p>“We want to ensure that each organ system is stable to improving and that he needs a minimal amount of assistance such that he does not need intensive nursing,” Pritts said. “We have some awesome rock star nurses who’ve been with him from the beginning, but he no longer needs that level of nursing care and no longer needs intensive respiratory therapy from our respiratory care practitioners and is able to then move to a setting where he would have less intensive care.”</p><p>A doctor accompanied Hamlin to the airport.</p><p>Doctors declined to speculate about whether Hamlin would be able to attend a game in person. By beating New England, the Bills (13-3) clinched home-field advantage through the first two rounds of the playoffs.</p><p>“Right now it's just a young man recovering from a very serious illness, and we think that he will recover well from this,” Pritts said. “He has a great positive attitude.”</p><p>Hamlin's heart stopped on Monday night after making what appeared to be a routine tackle in the first quarter against the Bengals. The game was initially suspended before officially being canceled later in the week.</p><p>News of Hamlin's discharge from the hospital in Cincinnati was greeted with enthusiasm.</p><p>"That’s unbelievable," Bengals coach Zac Taylor said.</p><p>“I mean, just think about it — that was one week, not even a week ago. There’s no one in this room that would have expected he’d be in Buffalo," he added. “God is great. He works miracles. This is certainly a miracle, there’s no question. ... And just an amazing moment for Damar.”</p><p>___</p><p>AP Sports Writer Mitch Stacy in Cincinnati contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL </p>]]></description>

(AP) — As Brazil <a href="https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-jair-bolsonaro-politics-brazil-government-8766c0ad2fcc4ae7c8bf1aa7f9aaa0ec?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=TopNews&amp;utm_campaign=position_01">reels</a> from mobs of rioters swarming its seats of power, its former leader has decamped to a Florida resort, where droves of supporters flocked to cheer on their ousted president.</p><p>Devotees have traveled in recent days to the temporary home of Jair Bolsonaro, a gated community with towering waterslides, for a chance to see him. He signed autographs, hugged children and took selfies with adoring masses, some sporting “Make Brazil Great Again” shirts.</p><p>“I will always support him,” said 31-year-old Rafael Silva, who left Brazil eight years ago and now installs flooring in central Florida, where he stood outside Bolsonaro’s rental home Monday. “He was the best for the country.”</p><p>By early afternoon, the handful of supporters in yellow jerseys dissipated as word spread that the divisive, hard-right leader was hospitalized with abdominal pain. His wife, Michelle, said on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/michellebolsonaro/3012092944613514280/">social media</a> that he had been hospitalized for observation due to abdominal discomfort related to a 2018 stabbing that has led to multiple hospitalizations in the past. A photo <a href="https://oglobo.globo.com/blogs/lauro-jardim/post/2023/01/bolsonaro-internado-num-hospital-nos-eua.ghtml">published</a> by Brazilian newspaper O Globo showed him smiling from his hospital bed. A hospital spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a phone call and text message.</p><div id="afs:Card:272901778982" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="099db80c6511119b534ca17747f871fe">Hub peek embed (JairBolsonaro) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Prior to Sunday’s angry storming of Brazil's Congress, Supreme Court and presidential palace, Bolsonaro had been seen repeatedly in this central Florida community, wandering a Publix supermarket’s aisles, dining alone at a local KFC and, most of all, surrounded by clusters of adoring fans. </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Though the Osceola County Sheriff’s Office said it received a request from the Secret Service to provide a police escort for Bolsonaro when he arrived and he was still a sitting president, he has not been surrounded by a noticeable phalanx of security.</p><p>“He will make himself right at home in Florida’s right-wing ecosystem of grifting and podcasting, finding allies with whomever thinks they can use him to advance their far-right agenda,” said Andy Reiter, a professor of politics and international relations at Mount Holyoke College who has researched foreign strongmen.</p><p>His new home, Encore Resort at Reunion in the suburbs of Orlando, is made up of furnished rental homes with foosball tables, screening rooms, Disney decor on the walls and Mickey Mouse stuffed animals on beds.</p><p>If it all seems too odd, the sight of the former leader of one of the world’s biggest countries wandering a gated community a stone’s throw from Walt Disney World in shorts, consider the history. </p><p>A stream of regional leaders have called the state home, at least for a time, over the past half century, from Haiti’s Prosper Avril to Nicaragua’s Anastasio Somoza to Panama’s Manuel Noriega. Alongside a list of other Latin American notables, they’ve camped out in both modest homes and elaborate mansions and, in the case of Noriega, a Miami prison cell, where he served 17 years on drug charges.</p><p>When asked by reporters Monday if the U.S. would send Bolsonaro back to Brazil, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the Biden administration hadn’t received any requests from Brazil related to the former president.</p><p>Brazilian Justice Minister Flavio Dino told reporters that, as of now, Brazil had no plans to ask the U.S. for Bolsonaro to be extradited.</p><p>A bevy of Brazilians have been lured to central Florida in the past two decades and have in turn transformed the region with scores of Brazilian shops and restaurants. </p><p>Florida has the largest population of residents who were born in Brazil – nearly 130,000 people –- of any U.S. state, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Many more come as visitors, with 830,000 Brazilians traveling to central Florida in 2019, the third largest international market for the area.</p><p>Though Lula da Silva won Brazil’s election by more than 2 million votes, Brazilian voters living in Florida appear to have heavily favored Bolsonaro. Election data for Brazilians living abroad shows 56 polling locations listed under Miami, the only Florida city under which data is compiled.</p><p>In each of the 56 areas, Bolsonaro prevailed, some by margins of 6-to-1. All told, more than 16,000 votes were counted among Brazilians under the Miami umbrella, with 81% favoring Bolsonaro.</p><p>“He is very popular with the Brazilian emigres in central Florida,” said Joel Stewart, former honorary consul for Brazil in Orlando. Brazil opened a consular office in Orlando last year.</p><p>Bolsonaro has long been called the “Trump of the tropics,” so it may come as no surprise that he wound up just a few hours’ drive away from the former American president’s Palm Beach compound. Both rode to power fueled by right-wing, anti-establishment anger, pursued nationalist platforms while in office, then spread lies about voter fraud in their own defeats. Followers of both men attacked the seats of government in anger after their preferred candidate lost.</p><p>Rodrigo Constantino, a right-wing Brazilian commentator who lives in Florida, says he sees parallels between Bolsonaro’s support in the state and the reelection triumph of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. Both, he said, amounted to rejections of “the totalitarian, woke, economic egalitarianism and sensational demagogy of the radical left.”</p><p>Whatever anger might exist against Bolsonaro in Brazil, Constantino says Brazilians living in Florida will understand and accept him.</p><p>“If he wants to come to my house and eat barbecue and chat about soccer or talk bad about communism, he will be very well received,” Constantino said.</p><p>___</p><p>Sedensky reported from New York.

(Ronen Zvulun/Pool Photo via AP)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s new government has wasted no time implementing its ultra-nationalist agenda, including adopting a seemingly petty ban on displaying the Palestinian flag and shaking the foundations of Israel’s democracy with a proposed legal assault on the Supreme Court.</p><p>After barely two weeks in power, the most hard-line and religious government in Israel’s history already is fomenting divisions at home and barreling toward conflict with the Palestinians and Israel’s allies abroad.</p><p>“We are not waiting, and I think the citizens of Israel already feel this,” Netanyahu told lawmakers in his Likud Party on Monday. “We formed a different government, with different policies, and we run things differently.”</p><p>Just days after taking office, his national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, visited Jerusalem’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-jerusalem-religion-israel-government-benjamin-netanyahu-a0e43cbddec11549e60754dc8231a222">most sensitive holy site</a> – a hilltop compound revered by Jews and Muslims. While Ben-Gvir respected existing norms that bar Jewish prayer at the site, the visit was seen by many as a provocation given his past calls for giving Jewish worshippers greater access. It drew Palestinian condemnations and angry statements from the U.S. and Israel’s own Arab allies.</p><p>Netanyahu has also taken aim at the internationally recognized Palestinian leadership in the occupied West Bank. Palestinians successfully lobbied the U.N. General Assembly to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-israel-government-west-bank-united-nations-dff4f816f0962eeeb16527caf763a695">seek a legal opinion</a> from the International Court of Justice on Israel’s policies in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem, and the Israeli government responded with a series of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-israel-palestinian-territories-government-middle-east-f795eb80d0c96c185cd2a3c6ea81119f">punitive measures</a>.</p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="c3419b07e43f853e9a8d44d55fc4a886">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Some of the steps have hit the Palestinians hard, such as withholding some $40 million in tax revenues and instead using the money to compensate Israeli victims of Palestinian violence. There are also plans to halt development in Palestinian villages in Israeli-controlled parts of the West Bank.</p><p>Other moves have been more symbolic, such as revoking the VIP privileges of top Palestinian officials and banning displays of Palestinian flags inside Israel. Israeli authorities over the weekend even broke up a meeting of Palestinian parents discussing their children’s school conditions in east Jerusalem. Israel claimed the meeting was funded by the Palestinian Authority but provided no supporting evidence.</p><p>Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh on Monday accused Israel of trying to “topple the authority and pushing it to the brink, financially and institutionally.”</p><p>At home, Netanyahu and his allies have unveiled a sweeping plan to overhaul the country’s justice system. The centerpiece proposal would give parliament the authority <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-israel-government-benjamin-netanyahu-5b240d4bc5d2fb8f533694fc6b7b7809">to overturn Supreme Court decisions</a> with a simple majority. Critics say that would destroy Israel’s democratic system of check and balances.</p><p>Thousands of Israelis joined a demonstration over the weekend against the proposed legal overhaul, and former Supreme Court President Aharon Barak warned that the plan would turn Israel into a “hollow democracy.” Benny Gantz, a former defense minister who now sits in the opposition, warned Monday that Netanyahu was pushing the country toward “civil war.”</p><p>The Netanyahu policies are no surprise. After four inconclusive elections in just three years, Netanyahu was able to eke out a victory in a fifth round of voting by joining forces with a collection of far-right and ultra-Orthodox partners.</p><p>“We received a clear mandate from the public, to carry out what we promised in the elections. That’s what we will do,” Netanyahu said at Monday's faction meeting.</p><p>The coalition is dominated by hard-liners who detest the Palestinians, oppose the idea of peace talks and reject the establishment an independent Palestinian state. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-elections-israel-benjamin-netanyahu-tel-aviv-65155b743a5a8e73eb4b4f50eff9229a">Ben-Gvir</a>, for instance, is a follower of a deceased radical rabbi who advocated mass expulsions of Palestinians from the country.</p><p>Convicted over a decade ago on incitement and domestic terrorism charges, Ben-Gvir is now a senior Cabinet minister overseeing the national police force. His partner, the hard-liner <a href="https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-religion-israel-west-bank-12ef4696a2ef2e6ca3a6a75ce3e114c0">Bezalel Smotrich</a>, is a settler leader who has been placed in charge of West Bank settlement construction.</p><p>Netanyahu, who is on trial for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-israel-benjamin-netanyahu-7d28197c9032d98d04a8951f3adc98fb">corruption charges</a>, was willing to turn over authority to his partners because they share his animosity toward a legal system they believe is elitist and hostile. It is widely believed that the legal overhaul, spearheaded by Justice Minister Yariv Levin, a close confidant of Netanyahu, will eventually lead to dismissal of the charges against the prime minister.</p><p>“This is the most extreme government that Israel has ever had,” said Nadav Eyal, an Israeli commentator and author of “Revolt,” a book about the rise of populism and nationalism worldwide. “What we’re seeing right now is a manifestation of their views, and they are basically doing what they promised.”</p><p>“To a large extent, the international community and many Israelis did not understand that they intend to actually implement much of their portfolio, and they don’t have anything to counter them politically,” he added.</p><p>Nahum Barnea, a veteran columnist at the Yediot Ahronot daily newspaper, said Netanyahu appears to be “testing the waters” by allowing his partners to promote their hard-line policies while he tries to deflect international criticism.</p><p>But he said Netanyahu will face problems reining in his coalition partners “because he doesn’t have partners for a more moderate policy.”</p><p>He said Netanyahu has no interest in picking a fight with the Biden administration. “But Netanyahu is no dictator. He has to take into consideration these very strong voices.”</p><p>Levin said last week that his plans to weaken the Supreme Court are just a first stage of action. The government’s published guidelines call for more West Bank settlement construction, the legalization of dozens of illegally built outposts and eventually the full annexation of the territory.</p><p>Such proposals will almost guarantee a showdown with the U.S., the Palestinians and the broader international community. The West Bank already is in the midst of its deadliest burst of violence in nearly two decades.</p><p>So far, the Biden administration has issued a series of cautious statements stressing the deep ties with Israel while reiterating the U.S. commitment to a two-state solution.</p><p>The tone could sharpen when top officials – including national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken – visit in the coming weeks.</p><p>Israel’s new Arab allies in the Gulf, particularly the United Arab Emirates, could also play a key role. The 2020 Abraham Accords between Israel and four Arab countries are among Netanyahu’s proudest accomplishments, and he has said he hopes to add Gulf heavyweight Saudi Arabia to the list.</p><p>The UAE criticized Ben-Gvir’s visit to the Jerusalem holy site, and according to Israeli media reports, delayed Netanyahu's plan to visit.</p><p>But any damage to relations was minor. The UAE is hosting Arab and Israeli and American diplomats this week ahead of a major regional summit expected this spring.</p>]]></description>

(Jan. 6)</p>    <p>NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) — The 6-year-old Virginia student who shot and wounded his teacher raised the handgun, pointed it at her and fired while she was teaching his first-grade class, a police chief said Monday. </p><p>Newport News Police Chief Steve Drew on Monday offered the first description of the shooting that shocked the city and was notable even in a country like that United States that seems inured to constant gun violence. Drew had previously said that the shooting was not accidental and declined to elaborate.</p><p>He said the student pulled the gun out, pointed at the teacher and fired at her. He said there was no physical struggle over the gun preceding the gunshot. No students were injured.</p><p>Drew said that the gun had been legally purchased by the child’s mother in York County. It was in the child’s residence, he put it in his backpack and brought it to school, the chief said.</p><p>The teacher who was wounded Friday in the shooting, Abby Zwerner, was in stable condition Monday at an area hospital. Describing her as a hero, Drew said he had spoken to her and one of her biggest concerns was for her students. </p><p>Drew said after the shooting, the boy was physically restrained by a school employee and that he struck the employee. The boy was taken away in a police car.</p><div id="afs:Card:056884756483" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="25cebfde17e46abc435c205210a7073d">Hub peek embed (apf-topnews) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Drew initially said the boy pulled the gun from his backpack just before the shooting, but then later clarified that the student had “the gun on his person” immediately before he fired the shot. </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>A candlelight vigil in honor of Zwerner was planned for Monday at 6:30 p.m.</p><p>Principal Briana Foster Newton said in an update on the school’s website that the school will be closed for the week. </p><p>Police have declined to describe what led to the altercation or any other details about what happened in the classroom, citing the ongoing investigation. </p><p>Virginia law does not allow 6-year-olds to be tried as adults. In addition, a 6-year-old is too young to be committed to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice if found guilty. Authorities have not specified where the boy was being held.</p><p>On Monday morning, several parents, grandparents and community members gathered with a local pastor in an open patch of grass outside the school. </p><div id="01b0c7cd2d6543bf8177586dcc33f072" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Among them was parent Eric Billet, who said each of his three children in the Newport News school system, two of whom go to Richneck, has reacted differently to the shooting.</p><p>Billet’s son who is in middle school has raised concerns about school security, telling his dad that he felt safer at theme parks, which the boy argued had better security than his school. His second-grade son is doing better, Billet said, fist-bumping a police officer on his way out of school Friday. </p><p>His daughter, a fourth-grader, has had nightmares every night, Billet said. </p><p>But at the same time, he said, “she was also disappointed she couldn’t go to school this week.”</p><p>___</p><p>Lavoie reported from Richmond.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/b5c0cfc9019e44e1baad06412fa9334a/3000.jpeg" alt="A man wades through a flooded street in the Rio Del Mar neighborhood of Aptos, Calif., Monday, Jan. 9, 2023.

(AP Photo/Nic Coury)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) — Rain-weary Californians grappled with flooding and mudslides Monday as the latest in a series of powerful storms walloped the state, prompting widespread evacuations, toppling trees and frustrating motorists who hit roadblocks caused by fallen debris. </p><p>Tens of thousands of people remained without power, and some schools closed for the day. The number of deaths related to the storms climbed from 12 to 14 on Monday, state officials said.</p><p>An evacuation order for the entire community of Montecito and surrounding canyons scarred by recent wildfires came on the <a href="https://apnews.com/60bdabd547a540b0b72da785739a9033/8-dead-in-Southern-California-as-rain-triggers-mudslides">fifth anniversary of a mudslide</a> that killed 23 people and destroyed more than 100 homes in the coastal enclave. </p><p>The National Weather Service reported that at least 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain fell over 12 hours, with several more inches predicted before the latest storm system moves through an area where roads wind along wooded hillsides studded with large houses. Upscale Montecito is squeezed between mountains and the Pacific and is home to celebrities including Oprah Winfrey, Rob Lowe and Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. </p><p>Jamie McLeod's property was under the Montecito evacuation order, but she said there is no way for her to get out with an overflowing creek on one side and a mudslide on the other.</p><p>“As of two hours ago, I am trapped,” she said Monday afternoon. “I can’t get off the mountain.”</p><p>The 60-year-old owner of the Santa Barbara Bird Sanctuary said one of her employees came to make a weekly food delivery and is stuck too.</p><p>McLeod said she feels fortunate because her home sits on high ground and the power is still on. But she said she tires of the frequent evacuation orders since the massive wildfire followed by the deadly landslide five years ago.</p><p>“It is not easy to relocate,” said McLeod. “I totally love it — except in catastrophe.”</p><p>Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said the decision to evacuate nearly 10,000 people was “based on the continuing high rate of rainfall with no indication that that is going to change before nightfall.” Creeks were overflowing, and many roads were flooded, he said. </p><p>Northbound lanes of U.S. 101, a key coastal route, were closed, along with several other highways and local roads.</p><p>Up the coast, evacuation orders were issued in coastal, woodsy Santa Cruz County for about 32,000 residents living near rain-swollen rivers and creeks, said Melodye Serino, the deputy county administrative officer. The San Lorenzo River was declared at flood stage, and drone footage showed numerous homes sitting in muddy brown water, the top halves of autos peeking out. </p><p>A large, muddy slide blocked both lanes of southbound Highway 17, a key but windy route into Santa Cruz from the San Francisco Bay Area. Vehicles were turned back at the summit as crews arrived to clean up.</p><p>Despite the deadly nature of storms, residents of tiny, flooded Felton remained calm and upbeat. </p><p>Christine Patracuola, the owner of Rocky’s Cafe for 25 years, handed out free coffee to customers whose homes lacked power Monday. Her staff couldn't come in because of closed roads, including a bridge over the San Lorenzo. </p><p>“A little coffee can’t hurt anybody," she said. “You can’t really change Mother Nature; you just have to roll with the punches and hope you don’t get swept up into it.” </p><p>Nicole Martin, third-generation owner of the Fern River Resort in Felton, said Monday that her clients sipped coffee, sat on cabin porches amid towering redwood trees, and were “enjoying the show” as picnic tables and other debris floated down the swollen San Lorenzo. </p><p>The river is usually about 60 feet (18 meters) below the cabins, Martin said, but it crept up to 12 feet (4 meters) from the cabins. Still, Martin said she wasn’t worried — her family has owned the property for about 60 years, and her grandfather checked out conditions Monday and shrugged it off.</p><p>In Northern California, several districts closed schools while the California Highway Patrol shared video of large boulders skidding down hillsides to block state roads. </p><p>More than 35,000 customers remained without power in Sacramento, down from more than 350,000 a day earlier after gusts of 60 mph (97 kph) knocked majestic trees into power lines, according to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District. </p><p>The National Weather Service warned of a “relentless parade of atmospheric rivers” — long plumes of moisture stretching out into the Pacific that can drop staggering amounts of rain and snow. The precipitation expected over the next couple of days comes after storms last week knocked out power to thousands, flooded streets, and battered the coastline.</p><p>President Joe Biden issued an emergency declaration Monday to support storm response and relief efforts in more than a dozen counties, including Sacramento, Santa Cruz and Los Angeles. </p><p>Gov. Gavin Newsom said on Sunday that 12 people died as a result of violent weather during the past 10 days, and he warned that this week’s storms could be even more dangerous and urged people to stay home. On Monday, the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services reported two more deaths by falling tree, one of a homeless person in Sacramento and the other of a person inside a home. </p><p>The first of the newest, heavier storms prompted the weather service to issue a flood watch for a large portion of Northern and Central California, with 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 centimeters) of rain expected through Wednesday in the already saturated Sacramento-area foothills. </p><p>In the Los Angeles area, there was potential for as much as 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain in foothill areas late Monday and Tuesday. High surf was also expected on west-facing beaches. </p><p>Since Dec. 26, San Francisco received more than 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain, while Mammoth Mountain, a popular ski area in the Eastern Sierra Nevada, got nearly 10 feet (3 meters) of snow, the National Weather Service said.</p><p>The storms won’t be enough to officially end California’s drought, but they have helped. </p><p>Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, expects a break in the rain after Jan. 18.</p><p>“That is my best guess right now, which is good because it will give the rivers in Northern California, and now in Central California, a chance to come down,” he said.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Stefanie Dazio in Los Angeles, Janie Har and Olga R.

After the sojourn, “we will do a season in Copenhagen."</p><p>"But I don’t want to commit to anything now,” Redzepi told Berlingske, one of Denmark's largest daily newspapers. </p><p>Another major publication, Politiken said the eatery’s facility in Copenhagen will be transformed to develop products to the Noma Projects line - fermented sauces, cooking classes and an online platform. </p><div id="afs:Card:312802700830" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="4a772a42e11833976b49be943e50bf57">Hub peek embed (Denmark) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>"Serving guests will still be a part of who we are but being a restaurant will no longer define us.

In 2015, the restaurant announced it was closing at the end of 2016 and reopened near its waterfront premises with its own vegetable farm in the vicinity of the hippie enclave of Christiania in Copenhagen.</p><p>Noma — a contraction of the Danish words for Nordisk and Mad, meaning Nordic and food, opened in 2003. The restaurant grabbed two Michelin stars and was three times voted the world’s number one restaurant by Britain’s Restaurant Magazine in 2010, 2011 and 2012.</p>]]></description>

In response, Denver converted three recreation centers into emergency shelters for migrants and paid for families with children to stay at hotels, allocating $3 million to deal with the influx. (AP Photo/Thomas Peipert)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>DENVER (AP) — Javier Guillen just wanted to get to the United States as he endured a three-month trek from Venezuela, hiking through Central American jungles and spending four days clinging to the roof of a Mexican train known as “the beast” to avoid police and kidnappers.</p><p>But when he finally arrived in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-united-states-government-mexico-el-paso-2e30ea26bbc55c7af509a6e60ad3d33c">El Paso, Texas</a>, last week, the 32-year-old settled on a new destination, only one relatively cheap bus ride away — Denver, an additional 680 miles (1,094 kilometers) north from the border.</p><p>“It’s the easiest place, closest to Texas, and there are people who’ll help immigrants here,” Guillen said before making his way to one of a network of shelters the city has scrambled to set up.</p><p>Over the past month, nearly 4,000 immigrants, almost all Venezuelans, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/texas-new-york-manhattan-religion-immigration-6d400698888dc0797f1883176baf12c7">have arrived unannounced in icy Denver</a>, with nowhere to stay and sometimes dressed in nothing more than T-shirts and flip-flops. The influx took city officials by surprise as they grappled with a spate of winter storms that plunged temperatures to record lows and disrupted transit out of the area. </p><p>When they appealed to the state to open new shelters, Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat who had allocated $4 million to help care for the migrants, arranged for those who wanted to travel onward to go by bus to Chicago and New York. That led New York Mayor Eric Adams, also a Democrat, who had already warned his city was being overwhelmed by new migrants, to complain about the transfers from Denver.</p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="103c21b26482306a25e08416295f9e78">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The situation illustrates how record numbers crossing the southern border are <a href="https://apnews.com/article/texas-new-york-florida-united-states-661f3489e74847bee88740fec40fe17c">reverberating northward to cities like Denver, New York and Washington</a> that have long been destinations for immigrants — but not <a href="https://apnews.com/article/florida-immigration-ron-desantis-charlie-baker-4fe96d293de4b189299a372b85c95add">busloads of them showing up all at once</a>, straight from the border and with no resources.</p><p>“They are getting a taste of what border cities have been facing,” said Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington. “The fact that people are showing up in groups with a need for basic services really is new for northern cities.”</p><p>In some instances, Republican governors — primarily Texas Gov. Greg Abbott — have tried to drive home that message by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/texas-kamala-harris-a0de34dd3b26941c0ae4fac2114586d0">transporting immigrants straight from the border</a> to New York or near Vice President Kamala Harris' Washington residence in the nation's capital. Last year Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-new-york-city-texas-greg-abbott-5af03544dc01ecc37209bec734bc477a">sent some to the resort island of Martha's Vineyard</a>.</p><p>It's not clear precisely how Denver became a new destination for Venezuelans fleeing their country's economic and political chaos. Advocates had detected small numbers arriving from the border earlier in 2022 and warned the route was becoming increasingly popular.</p><p>Then, last fall, many traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border in hopes the Biden administration would end a pandemic regulation that lets the country automatically return asylum seekers to Mexico. Instead, President Joe Biden <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-venezuela-mexico-spokane-violence-0eb316a474baed22f433359b0644320b">added Venezuelans to the nationalities covered by the rule in October</a>. Venezuelan crossings dropped at the border, but then something changed in Denver.</p><p>Whatever the trigger, the number of migrants arriving in the city spiked dramatically in December to sometimes 200 a day, just as a bitter winter freeze and record low temperatures swept through. The storms snarled roads out of the city and canceled several scheduled bus trips to points east, stranding many in a city already struggling to shelter its homeless population.</p><p>In response, Denver converted three recreation centers into emergency shelters for migrants and paid for families with children to stay at hotels, allocating $3 million to deal with the influx. It reassigned workers to process the new arrivals, assign them to shelters and help them get on buses. Residents donated piles of winter clothing.</p><p>“Cities and states are ill-equipped to deal with this,” Mayor Michael Hancock said in an interview. “Whether you're on the border or in Denver, Colorado, cities are not set up for this.”</p><p>Amelia Iraheta, a city public health employee reassigned to work with the migrants, said one man reported walking from the border and arrived with a broken foot. One woman, who reached Denver barefoot, still had her feet covered with cactus spines after walking through the borderland desert. Most wore just the clothes on their back — woefully insufficient for the subzero temperatures.</p><p>“Coming into Denver in the peak of winter, conditions were not exactly what I think they had been expecting,” Iraheta said.</p><p>Most weren't intending to stay long. The city and state say about 70% of the more than 3,800 migrants who've come to Denver since they began tracking on Dec. 9 planned to go elsewhere ultimately. More than 1,600, the city says, have already left town on their own accord.</p><p>Polis' office said he was not available for an interview. “The state's priority is ensuring people are receiving the resources they need and can reach their desired final destination, which is the opposite of actions other states have taken to send people to places they likely had no intention of going to,” spokesman Conor Cahill said in a statement.</p><p>Jennifer Piper of the American Friends Service Committee, which has worked with the city and several nonprofits to help the migrants, inspected one of the buses before it left Denver. She said all passengers agreed they were on it voluntarily and that almost all had friends or family in New York or Chicago to stay with.</p><p>“These are grown-ups in control of their own destiny,” Piper said. “The reality is they were going to be on Greyhound buses eventually.”</p><p>The city has set a 14-day limit on stays in the emergency shelters and is talking to other agencies and nonprofits about opening longer-term facilities. It's unclear how Biden's <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-mexico-immigration-af0643a4fb8f45388fe247e44c9b2c5e">new immigration policy</a>, which opens an additional 30,000 monthly slots for asylum applicants from Venezuela and three other Latin American nations, will affect the flow into Denver.</p><p>“I really think this is not a flash in the pan,” Piper said. “Denver is now on that route, and I don't think that will shift for at least the next 5-6 months.”</p><p>It may last longer. Alexander Perez, 23, took the same daunting, monthslong overland journey through Colombia, Central America and Mexico as many other Venezuelans. It includes <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-health-colombia-forests-united-states-c9179be12e415f4b36145f0f29470e3b">a particularly brutal stretch of jungle isthmus</a> into Panama known as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/colombia-south-america-panama-f586b73668dcdc15649b82e79b1929cf">the Darien Gap</a>, devoid of any roads and plagued by armed marauders and deadly natural perils. </p><p>Along the way he kept thinking about joining a cousin in New York. Following a week in El Paso, he hopped a bus to Denver with the intent of continuing northeast. But after finding a warm welcome and, eventually, a hotel room, he began to reconsider his itinerary. He needed to make some money before heading on. </p><p>“Sometimes God leads you places,” Perez said, standing outside a supermarket, eyeing mounds of dirty snow. </p><p>Maybe, Perez mused, he could stay and earn some money shoveling.</p>]]></description>

The report concluded an extraordinary 18-month investigation into the former president and the violent attack.</p><p>Special grand juries in Georgia cannot issue indictments but instead can issue a final report recommending actions to be taken. </p><p>Willis opened the investigation in early 2021, shortly after a recording surfaced of a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-georgia-elections-a7b4aa4d8ce3bf52301ddbe620c6bff6">Jan. 2, 2021, phone call</a> between Trump and Raffensperger.

The 16 Republican fake electors have also been told they are targets of the investigation, according to public court filings. It is possible that others have also been notified they are targets of the investigation.</p><p>Trump and his allies have consistently denied any wrongdoing, with the former president repeatedly describing his call with Raffensperger as “perfect” and dismissing Willis' investigation as a “strictly political Witch Hunt!”</p><p>Willis took the unusual step in January 2022 of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-georgia-united-states-atlanta-election-2020-582aa817b935517deeb507c9bc46b0dd">requesting that a special grand jury be seated</a> to aid the investigation. She noted that a special grand jury would have subpoena power which would help compel testimony from witnesses who were otherwise unwilling to participate in the investigation. </p><p>In a letter asking the court to impanel the special grand jury, Willis wrote that her office had received information indicating a “reasonable probability” that Georgia’s 2020 election, including the presidential race, “was subject to possible criminal disruptions.” Her <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-elections-presidential-elections-atlanta-5c0e6349c3677cc0fdd6a9e045d02c18">request was granted</a> and the special grand jury was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-donald-trump-georgia-presidential-8823a1c619ca26be91f8d76b83a9f974">seated in May</a>.</p>]]></description>

(NASA via AP, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>DENVER (AP) — Earth’s protective ozone layer is slowly but noticeably healing at a pace that would fully mend the hole over Antarctica in about 43 years, a new United Nations report says.</p><p>A once-every-four-years <a href="https://ozone.unep.org/system/files/documents/Scientific-Assessment-of-Ozone-Depletion-2022-Executive-Summary.pdf">scientific assessment</a> found recovery in progress, more than 35 years after every nation in the world agreed to stop producing chemicals that chomp on the layer of ozone in Earth’s atmosphere that shields the planet from harmful radiation linked to skin cancer, cataracts and crop damage. </p><p>“In the upper stratosphere and in the ozone hole we see things getting better," said Paul Newman, co-chair of the scientific assessment. </p><p>The progress is slow, according to the report presented Monday at the American Meteorological Society convention in Denver. The global average amount of ozone 18 miles (30 kilometers) high in the atmosphere won’t be back to 1980 pre-thinning levels until about 2040, the report said. And it won’t be back to normal in the Arctic until 2045.</p><p>Antarctica, where it’s so thin there’s an annual giant gaping hole in the layer, won't be fully fixed until 2066, the report said.</p><p>Scientists and environmental advocates across the world have long hailed the efforts to heal the ozone hole — springing out of a 1987 agreement called the Montreal Protocol that banned a class of chemicals often used in refrigerants and aerosols — as one <a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-science-health-business-canada-14e791bd2f718ff052ba935435cac0b8">of the biggest ecological victories</a> for humanity.</p><div id="afs:Card:926746779134" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="83794d6e5ae6c4469b60effb185d1509">Hub peek embed (apf-science) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“Ozone action sets a precedent for <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment">climate action</a>. Our success in phasing out ozone-eating chemicals shows us what can and must be done – as a matter of urgency — to transition away from fossil fuels, reduce greenhouse gases and so limit temperature increase,” World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas said in a statement.</p><p>Signs of healing were reported four years ago but were slight and more preliminary. “Those numbers of recovery have solidified a lot,” Newman said.</p><p>The two chief chemicals that munch away at ozone are in lower levels in the atmosphere, said Newman, chief Earth scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. Chlorine levels are down 11.5% since they peaked in 1993 and bromine, which is more efficient at eating ozone but is at lower levels in the air, dropped 14.5% since its 1999 peak, the report said.</p><p>That bromine and chlorine levels “stopped growing and is coming down is a real testament to the effectiveness of the Montreal Protocol,” Newman said.</p><p>“There has been a sea change in the way our society deals with ozone depleting substances,” said scientific panel co-chair David W. Fahey, director of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s chemical sciences lab.</p><p>Decades ago, people could go into a store and buy a can of refrigerants that eat away at the ozone, punch a hole in it and pollute the atmosphere, Fahey said. Now, not only are the substances banned but they are no longer much in people’s homes or cars, replaced by cleaner chemicals.</p><p>Natural weather patterns in the Antarctic also affect ozone hole levels, which peak in the fall. And the past couple years, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/science-business-climate-and-environment-9e375202690826cb42e6397c65200a24">holes have been a bit bigger</a> because of that but the overall trend is one of healing, Newman said.</p><p>This is “saving 2 million people every year from skin cancer,” United Nations Environment Programme Director Inger Andersen told The Associated Press earlier this year in an email.</p><p>A few years ago emissions of one of the banned chemicals, chlorofluorocarbon-11 (CFC-11), stopped shrinking <a href="https://apnews.com/article/0aed47a7933a457b8cd1182ed7853891">and was rising</a>. Rogue emissions were spotted in part of China but now have gone back down to where they are expected, Newman said.</p><p>A third generation of those chemicals, called HFC, was banned a few years ago not because it would eat at the ozone layer but because it is a heat-trapping greenhouse gas. The new report says that the ban would avoid 0.5 to 0.9 degrees (0.3 to 0.5 degrees Celsius) of additional warming.</p><p>The report also warned that efforts to artificially cool the planet by putting aerosols into the atmosphere to reflect the sunlight would thin the ozone layer by as much as 20% in Antarctica.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP’s climate and environment coverage at <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment">https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment</a></p><p>___</p><p>Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/borenbears">@borenbears</a></p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

So we have to change the whole rhythm again.”</p><p>It’s the opposite of how Shiffrin went from an evening race in Zagreb, Croatia, last week to the earlier starting times in Slovenia.</p><p>But Shiffrin has learned throughout her extraordinary career how to deal with just these types of challenges, as displayed when she recently won five consecutive races across three different disciplines — super-G, giant slalom and slalom — at three different resorts.</p><p>Also, slalom is Shiffrin’s best event, the discipline that has accounted for 51 of her 82 wins — four of which came in Flachau.</p><div id="afs:Card:541131129162" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="eb3b1478862676e3a3e141de7c4e2de7">Hub peek embed (Skiing) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Shiffrin has already won four of the six slaloms this season, including the last two.</p><p>No wonder she feels confident about setting the record in the hometown of Hermann Maier, another one of the most successful racers in the sport.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“If I ski my best slalom, I have a really good chance to take the victory,” Shiffrin said. “But there’s a lot of other athletes who are sick of that. So we’ll see what happens.”</p><p>While not quite as rowdy as the nearby men’s night slalom in Schladming, the Flachau race usually attracts a decent crowd of about 15,000 spectators.</p><p>Breaking the record in Austria, a country where ski racing is the top sport, would be memorable.</p><p>“It’s pretty impressive that the top two female skiers of all time are Americans in a sport historically dominated by Europeans,” <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sports-mikaela-shiffrin-lindsey-vonn-austria-alpine-skiing-ec3a0095dd2ae28da59e33402c706dee">Vonn wrote in a guest column for The Associated Press</a>. “We’re 20 wins ahead of the next woman (Annemarie Moser-Pröll of Austria with 62 wins), which is a substantial margin. So it’s not even really close. It just speaks for our country as a whole and what we’re capable of doing.”</p><p>Shiffrin said the recent rise of teammates <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sports-mikaela-shiffrin-alpine-skiing-vienna-wendy-holdener-d83d52e0bcdca74aafe81f5cf15133a6">Paula Moltzan</a> and Nina O’Brien made her realize how much effort it takes to get to the top for other Americans.</p><p>“It’s so hard to focus the right resources in such a big country,” Shiffrin said. “It makes the future even more exciting than anything our team has accomplished in the past.”</p><p>What Shiffrin herself is accomplishing, though, is unlike anything any other skier has done.</p><p>Her 82 wins have come in 233 races for a 35% win rate. In other words, Shiffrin wins one of about every three races she enters. And she has finished on the podium in more than half of her races, 129 out of 233, or 55%.</p><p>What’s more is that Shiffrin is only 27, while Vonn was 33 when she got to 82. Shiffrin could compete for many more years and win many more races, perhaps even set the new standard above 100 wins.</p><p>“It’s mindboggling, really, when you think about the number of years she’s had this level of performance and at an early age,” said U.S. ski team women’s head coach Paul Kristofic, who also coached Vonn at the end of her career. “She’s a remarkable person and a remarkable athlete. Maybe once in a lifetime you see somebody like this.”</p><p>It seems like a foregone conclusion that Shiffrin will also soon break Ingemar Stenmark’s overall record — between men and women — of 86 wins.</p><p>So then the question is will Shiffrin be considered the greatest skier ever?</p><p>Shiffrin and Vonn both won four overall World Cup titles — which is considered the greatest prize in the ski racing community — and Shiffrin is on track for a fifth title this season.</p><p>Marcel Hirscher holds the record with eight overall titles and Moser-Pröll has the women’s mark with six.</p><p>“I think everything is based on statistics and records,” said Mike Day, the head coach of Shiffrin’s personal team. “At the moment, she’s clearly one of the best ever. But I think you have to look at Stenmark and Vonn and Hirscher and have massive respect for what people have done prior to her.”</p><p>Piero Gros, the 1976 Olympic slalom champion from Italy who raced against Stenmark, said there’s no point in comparing racers from different eras.</p><p>“Shiffrin is up there in paradise. What more can an athlete do? She’s extraordinary. And I’m sure she’s still struggling inside after the loss of her father,” Gros said, referring to when Shiffrin’s father, Jeff, died three years ago. “We know how much talent she has but she clearly also has a lot of inner strength.</p><p>“The Americans always seem to produce these champions,” Gros added, “which is incredible in this European world of skiing.”</p><p>___</p><p>Andrew Dampf is at https://twitter.com/AndrewDampf</p><p>___</p><p>More AP skiing: https://apnews.com/hub/skiing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports</p>]]></description>

The Russian Defense Ministry said its missiles hit two temporary bases housing 1,300 Ukrainian troops in the city, killing 600 of them, late Saturday.</p><p>Associated Press reporters visiting the scene in sunny weather Monday saw a four-story concrete building with most of its windows blown out. Inside, locals were cleaning up debris, sweeping up broken glass and hurling broken furniture out into a missile crater below.</p><p>A separate, six-story school building was largely undamaged. There were neither signs of a Ukrainian military presence nor any casualties.</p><p>Yana Pristupa, the school’s deputy director, scoffed at Moscow’s claims of hitting a troop concentration. </p><p>“Nobody saw a single spot of blood anywhere,” she told the AP. “Everyone saw yesterday that no one carried out any bodies. It’s just people cleaning up.”</p><p>She said that before the war began last February the school had more than 300 students, most of them studying mechanical engineering, with most lessons moving online when Russia invaded. </p><div id="afs:Card:521103274690" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="79b6b7c903985358517088278d81cebe">Hub peek embed (Russia-Ukraine) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The students “are now in shock,” she said, adding, “What a great facility it was.”</p><p>Ukrainian officials on Sunday quickly denied the Russian claims it had lost a large number of soldiers in the attack.</p><p>Despite the absence of any evidence, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said reports from the scene didn’t shake senior officials’ faith in defense authorities.</p><p>“The Defense Ministry is the main, legitimate and comprehensive source of information about the course of the special military operation,” Peskov said Monday in a conference call with reporters, using the Kremlin’s term for the war.</p><p>Both sides have regularly claimed killing hundreds of each other’s soldiers in attacks. The claims can seldom be independently verified because of the fighting.</p><p>Moscow’s allegations may have backfired domestically, however, as some Russian military bloggers criticized them.</p><p>The Institute for the Study of War think tank said the bloggers “responded negatively to the Russian (Ministry of Defense’s) claim, pointing out that the Russian MoD frequently presents fraudulent claims and criticizing Russian military leadership for fabricating a story ... instead of holding Russian leadership responsible for the losses accountable.”</p><p>A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman said the strikes on Kramatorsk were in retaliation for Ukraine’s attack in Makiivka on New Year’s Eve, in which at least 89 Russian soldiers gathered at a temporary barracks died, according to Moscow. Ukrainian authorities said hundreds were killed.</p><p>It was one of the deadliest attacks on the Kremlin’s forces since the war began more than 10 months ago and an embarrassing loss.</p><p>Such revenge strikes have occurred before. When Ukraine in early October <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-explosions-fires-kharkiv-a5d6dd74e0fc8301cdd87601f5e2db1f">struck a bridge</a> linking the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula with Russia, damaging an important supply artery for the Kremlin’s faltering war effort in southern Ukraine and hitting a key symbol of Russian power in the region, the Kremlin sent a first massive barrage against <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-estonia-moscow-d6436a6fd6ee2e65748f6a2b4988e167">Ukraine’s energy facilities</a>. It was billed as retaliation for the bridge attack and heralded a period of relentless bombardments against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure.</p><p>Ukraine's deputy defense minister said Monday that Russian forces have launched a fresh assault on the town of Soledar in the eastern Donetsk region. Taking Soledar would allow Russia to intensify its attacks on the strategically key city of Bakhmut, where intense fighting has destroyed an estimated 60% of buildings. </p><p>In the Luhansk region, most of which is under Russian control, two residents of the village of Nevske were killed in Russian shelling on Monday, Luhansk governor Serhii Haidai said.</p><p>Ukraine’s presidential office reported Monday that at least three civilians were killed and 12 others wounded over the previous 24 hours as nine Ukrainian regions in the southeast of the country were shelled.</p><p>In one attack on Monday, two people were killed and five others, including a 13-year-old girl, were wounded by a Russian rocket strike that hit a village market in the northeastern Kharkiv region, Ukrainian officials said.</p><p>Kharkiv regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said the strike hit Shevchenkove village. Photos on his Telegram channel showed ruined pavilions, some of them still on fire, and rubble all around them.</p><p>According to Ukrainian officials, more people could be trapped under the rubble. A rescue operation to find them was underway.</p><p>Russia maintains it is fighting against the might of NATO, not just the Ukrainians.</p><p>Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Russia’s Security Council, repeated that argument in an interview published Monday, saying that “the events in Ukraine aren’t a clash between Moscow and Kyiv, it’s a military confrontation between NATO, and particularly the U.S. and Britain, with Russia.”</p><p>“The sooner the citizens of Ukraine realize that the West is fighting Russia with their hands, the more lives will be saved,” Patrushev said in an interview with Argumenty i Fakty.</p><p>Meanwhile, two U.K. citizens working as volunteers in eastern Ukraine have disappeared, the Ukrainian national police said Monday.</p><p>Andrew Bagshaw and Christopher Perry left Kramatorsk on Friday bound for Soledar, where heavy fighting is reported, and contact with them was lost, police said.</p><p>Bagshaw, a resident of New Zealand, was in Ukraine to assist in delivering humanitarian aid, according to New Zealand media reports.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP’s coverage of the war at <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine">https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine</a></p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>LONDON (AP) — <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/prince-harry">Prince Harry</a> has accused his stepmother, Camilla, the queen consort, of leaking private conversations to the media to burnish her own reputation as he promotes a new book that lays bare his story of his life behind palace walls.</p><p>In interviews broadcast Sunday and Monday, Harry accused members of the royal family of getting “into bed with the devil” to gain favorable tabloid coverage, singling out Camilla’s efforts to rehabilitate her image with the British people after her longtime affair with his father, now King Charles III.</p><p>“That made her dangerous because of the connections that she was forging within the British press,” he told CBS. “There was open willingness on both sides to trade information. And with a family built on hierarchy, and with her on the way to being queen consort, there was gonna be people or bodies left in the street.”</p><div id="afs:Card:611836720368" content-id="4141be64bcd1521d1d5cf0f9b65e20b5" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (PrinceHarry) - Compressed layout </div><p>Harry spoke to Britain’s ITV, CBS’s “60 Minutes” and “Good Morning America″ to promote his book “Spare,” which is to be widely released Tuesday. Some U.K. bookshops plan to open at midnight to meet demand <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-united-kingdom-prince-harry-books-and-literature-nonfiction-7082bf624e4b43826d0cc39ce69f961f">for the highly anticipated memoir,</a> which has generated <a href="https://apnews.com/article/queen-elizabeth-ii-king-charles-iii-politics-united-kingdom-prince-harry-952c0cbaa0c39d18b8338ca651b49394">incendiary headlines</a> with reports that it includes details of bitter family resentments, as well as Harry and his wife Meghan’s decision to give up their royal roles and move to California.</p><p>In the interviews, Harry repeatedly blamed the media for the troubles that afflicted the couple, also known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, saying the coverage contributed to the rift with his brother, Prince William, and his wife, Kate.</p><p>“They always pitched us against each other,″ he told Good Morning America. “They pitch Kate and Meghan against each other.”</p><p>Harry was also unapologetic about launching legal battles against some parts of the British media. While he said his father believes it is “probably a suicide mission” to take on the press, Harry described changing the media landscape in the UK as being “my life’s work.”</p><p>But Harry also continued to criticize the royal family itself.</p><p>He repeated his claim that there was “concern” in the royal family about his unborn child’s skin color after he married biracial American actress Meghan Markle. Harry and Meghan first mentioned the incident during an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021, but they haven’t identified the family member who expressed concern.</p><p>Harry insisted his family wasn’t racist, but said the episode was an example of unconscious bias. The prince told CBS that he was “probably bigoted” before he met Meghan, and said that the royal family, which is held to a higher moral standard, needed to “learn and grow” in order to be “part of the solution rather than part of the problem.”</p><p>“Otherwise unconscious bias then moves into the category of racism,” Harry told ITV. </p><p>“Spare” explores Harry’s grief over the death of his mother in 1997, and his long-simmering resentment at his role as the royal “spare,” overshadowed by the “heir” — older brother William. He recounts arguments and a physical altercation with William, reveals how he lost his virginity and describes using cocaine and cannabis.</p><p>He also says <a href="https://apnews.com/article/prince-harry-afghanistan-service-claims-1c497d35a8211dc0366429856a539e2a">he killed 25 Taliban fighters</a> while serving as an Apache helicopter pilot <a href="https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-nato-politics-taliban-prince-harry-603f12d84207e994dc16e556a556960d">in Afghanistan</a> — drawing criticism from both the Taliban and British military veterans.</p><p>The allegations about Camilla are particularly sensitive because of her role in the acrimonious breakdown of Charles’ marriage to the late Princess Diana, William and Harry’s mother. </p><p>Diana once described Camilla, who carried out a long-term affair with Charles, as the third person in their marriage. While many members of the public initially shunned Camilla, she has won fans by taking on a wide range of charitable activities and has been credited with helping Charles appear less stuffy and more in tune with modern Britain. </p><p>Writing about his father’s 2005 wedding to Camilla, Harry says: “I had complex feelings about gaining a stepparent who, I believed, had recently sacrificed me on her personal PR altar.” Still, he says he wanted his father to be happy. “In a funny way I even wanted Camilla to be happy. Maybe she’d be less dangerous if she was happy?”</p><p>“Spare” is the latest in a string of public pronouncements by Harry and Meghan since they quit royal life and moved to California in 2020, citing what they saw as the media’s racist treatment of Meghan and a lack of support from the palace. It follows the interview with Winfrey and a six-part Netflix series released last month.</p><p>In the ghostwritten memoir, Harry, 38, describes the couple’s acrimonious split from the royal family after their request for a part-time royal role was rejected. </p><p>The television interviews are certain to pile more pressure on the royal family. Harry is also appearing on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”</p><p>Royal officials haven’t commented on any of the allegations, though allies have pushed back on the claims, largely anonymously.</p><p>Harry has defended the memoir describing it as his effort to “own my story” after years of “spin and distortion” by others. In the “60 Minutes” interview, Harry denied his book was intended to hurt his family. </p><p>Omid Scobie, co-author of “Finding Freedom,” a book on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, said Harry is offering the look behind the palace walls that the public has always wanted.</p><p>“Of course, that does come with some downsides for those who have been part of his journey,″ Scobie told the BBC. “We heard some sort of really startling confessions and stories about members of the royal family, particularly when it comes to Camilla and her relationship with the press.’’</p><p>While Harry <a href="https://apnews.com/article/prince-harry-memoir-royal-family-cac109c42b6e1e5d0298e9a5a146ae2e">said he hadn’t spoken with his father or brother in a while,</a> he hopes to find peace with them. But he told ITV that the “the ball is in their court.”</p><p>“They’ve shown absolutely no willingness to reconcile,” he said.</p><p>While the saga is damaging to the royal family, it may not be as harmful as people might think and will give the global audience a forum to discuss difficult issues like misogyny and racism, said Boston University professor Arianne Chernock, an expert in modern British history. </p><p>But she was cautious about doomsayers suggesting the monarchy itself was in trouble. The institution has endured more than 1,000 years after all. </p><p>“This is a central component of the history of the royal family,’’ she said. “Scandal is the norm not the exception.’’</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press Writer Jill Lawless contributed.</p>]]></description>

A pivotal game between the Bills and Bengals suddenly was irrelevant.</p><p>The primary concern for players, coaches, the league and fans around the world became Hamlin’s health. The 24-year-old Bills safety collapsed and went into cardiac arrest after making a tackle and needed to be resuscitated on the field in a scary scene witnessed by millions watching “Monday Night Football.”</p><p>For a couple of days, it was unknown when the NFL would resume playing. The league announced Wednesday that Week 18 was still on schedule, and Hamlin made remarkable progress in his recovery by Thursday. He spoke to teammates for the first time Friday, telling them: “Love you boys.”</p><p>Inspired by his motivational words, the NFL community returned to work filled with hope instead of heavy hearts.</p><p>The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-england-patriots-buffalo-bills-sports-nfl-football-damar-hamlin-47dc11b56ec33560542cd3847db4de45">league honored Hamlin</a> in various ways this weekend, dedicating all the games to him and recognizing the first responders and doctors who saved his life.</p><div id="afs:Card:234821764243" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="2850fdfa5fd44dea388a09caa31430ba">Hub peek embed (NFL) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Then, players gave Hamlin the ultimate tribute with their performance.</p><p>Nyheim Hines returned the game’s opening kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown in front of a charged-up crowd at Buffalo’s Highmark Stadium on Sunday.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“We’ve had so many prayers and so much support and to be able to start the game like that, it was amazing,” Hines said. “All that was for him. I felt like he was out there with us. .... This is bigger than me. It's bigger than the 10 guys blocking for me.”</p><p>Hines did it again in the third quarter, taking a kickoff 101 yards for a go-ahead score in a 35-23 win over the New England Patriots that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-england-patriots-buffalo-bills-miami-dolphins-york-jets-nfl-25243cdf2ceb3780419859fc39537ef4">locked up the AFC’s No. 2 seed</a> for the Bills (13-3).</p><p>The Bills hadn’t returned a kickoff for a TD since Oct. 20, 2019, a span of nearly three years and three months.

Under the plan, the U.S. will send 30,000 migrants per month from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela back across the border from among those who entered the U.S. illegally. Migrants who arrive from those four countries are not easily returned to their home countries for a variety of reasons. </p><p>In addition, 30,000 people per month from those four nations who get sponsors, background checks and an airline flight to the U.S. will get the ability to work legally in the country for two years. </p><p>Biden arrived in Mexico on Sunday night via the new <a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-technology-travel-business-health-c3e5a593e5f99167b94f8b037b7cc60c">Felipe Angeles International Airport</a>, a prized project of the Mexican president. The hub was christened last year with fanfare, though it's more than an hour's drive north of the city center, has few flights and until recently lacked consistent drinking water. </p><p>The two leaders took the long drive into the city center in Biden's limousine. López Obrador was fascinated by the presidential vehicle known as “the beast,” and said Biden showed it off to him.</p><p>“He himself showed me how the buttons work,” Lopez Obrador said. </p><p>The Mexican president described the two leaders' first encounter of the trip as “very pleasant," and he said “President Biden is a friendly person.”</p><p>It was a notably warm comment given that the men's relationship has been merely transactional at best and absent the warmth and camaraderie Biden has with some other world leaders. </p><p>On his way to Mexico, Biden stopped in El Paso, Texas, for four hours — <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-united-states-government-mexico-el-paso-2e30ea26bbc55c7af509a6e60ad3d33c">his first trip to the border as president</a> and the longest he's spent along the U.S-Mexico line. The visit was highly controlled and seemed designed to counter Republican claims of a crisis situation by showcasing a smooth operation to process migrants entering legally, weed out smuggled contraband and humanely treat those who've entered illegally. </p><p>But the trip was likely to do little to quell critics from both sides, including immigrant advocates who accuse the Democratic president of establishing cruel policies not unlike those of his hardline predecessor, Republican Donald Trump.</p><p>The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-venezuela-mexico-spokane-violence-0eb316a474baed22f433359b0644320b">number of migrants</a> crossing the U.S.-Mexico border has risen dramatically during Biden's first two years in office. There were more than 2.38 million stops during the year that ended Sept. 30, the first time the number topped 2 million. </p><p>López Obrador will formally welcome Biden at the Palacio Nacional later Monday, the first time since 2014 that Mexico has hosted a U.S. president. The two leaders will meet together ahead of a private dinner for all three leaders and their wives. Biden and Trudeau will hold their own talks Tuesday, and then the three leaders will gather for the main summit discussions. </p><p>First lady Jill Biden arrived separately in Mexico. On Monday, she met with women from the fields of education, art and business, most of them recipients of U.S. cooperation programs or scholarships.</p><p>“Do whatever you want but teach others," she said as she encouraged the women to work together and support others.</p><p>For the U.S., the major summit talking points are migration, drug trafficking and building on Biden’s push on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-detroit-north-america-auto-show-e30f83b1d6e7df491b1a7953507dbaa4">electric vehicles</a> and manufacturing. Mexico is focused on economic integration for North America, supporting the poor in the Americas and regional relationships that put all governments on equal footing. Canada is looking to expand on green initiatives. </p><p>The leaders of Canada and Mexico have voiced concerns over <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-joe-biden-government-and-politics-business-health-3bfa727e9b844216bc984fb30c82a895">Biden’s “Buy American” plan</a>. And while Biden’s push toward electric vehicles is a boon to both U.S. neighbors because of the tax credits for North American batteries, there’s concern the U.S. allies will be left behind.</p><p>Meantime, the U.S. and Canada accuse López Obrador of trying to favor Mexico’s state-owned utility over power plants built by foreign and private investors, something that's forbidden under the three countries’ free trade pact.</p><p>Biden's relationship with Trudeau is warmer than with Lopez Obrador, but he still hasn't made it to Canada during his presidency, despite White House officials saying for months he planned to head north following a summit of the Americas in Los Angeles last fall. </p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-covid-politics-health-6efb4c2bde5d080a9ee400a0981f7a61">López Obrador skipped the California summit</a> because Biden didn't invite the authoritarian regimes of Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. He's also made no secret of his admiration for Trump. And he was one of only three world leaders who didn't recognize Biden’s election victory until after the formal Electoral College vote and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/congress-confirm-joe-biden-78104aea082995bbd7412a6e6cd13818">the Jan. 6 insurrection</a> at the U.S. Capitol. </p><p>Despite the fraught relationship, they recognize each other's importance, said Andrew Selee, head of the immigration think tank Migration Policy Institute in Washington.</p><p>“They are both consummate politicians," he said. “They're looking for what the other person needs, and they're trying to make clear what they need. It's very transactional. There isn't a big vision for the relationship right now.”</p><p>For Biden, that meant flying into the new airport, one of four keystone projects López Obrador is racing to finish before his term ends next year, as Mexico doesn't allow reelection. The other projects are an oil refinery, a tourist train in the Yucatan Peninsula and a train linking Gulf coast and Pacific seaports.</p><p>López Obrador has faced much criticism over the airport that is expected to cost $4.1 billion and was built after he canceled the partly constructed airport created by his predecessor. During construction of Felipe Angeles in 2020, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/international-news-latin-america-caribbean-science-29d8dd7da7b8bce72eee1fa3656e630a">hundreds of mammoth skeletons</a> were uncovered. </p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Andres Leighton in El Paso, Texas; Anita Snow in Phoenix; Morgan Lee in Santa Fe, New Mexico; Mark Stevenson in Mexico City and Chris Megerian and Josh Boak in Washington contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

This particular version of the familiar houseplant was bioengineered to remove 30 times the amount of indoor air pollutants of a typical house plant, according to Neoplants, the Paris-based company that created it.</p><p>Customers are already joining a waitlist for seedlings still in the nursery.</p><p>Neoplants founder and CEO Lionel Mora is a passionate former Google employee who sings a bit of a different tune than other founders at the electronics convention, with its technology-can-solve-anything vibe. He says before people turn to engineering solutions, they need to address consumption. But, "when it comes to innovation, we believe that biology is the way to go because it’s sustainable by design,” he said.</p><p>As countries grapple with how to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-science-business-scotland-europe-7b282af7df95b55dff2630e158631a73">limit global warming</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-united-nations-biodiversity-climate-and-environment-eee5683a8fac71540f94e9934031bd22">protect natural resources and biodiversity</a>, more companies are growing their own commitments to building sustainable supply chains and slowing emissions. For others, like Neoplants, addressing environmental issues is their whole reason for being.</p><div id="afs:Card:710305756722" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="31d2663e9e47b6e18f99d87afc311338">Hub peek embed (apf-technology) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Companies and start-ups at CES touched on a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/CES-2023-las-vegas-climate-technology-0d0e84044c3d5218b10dc032cd2ff3c4">broad range of those efforts</a>. Austin-based Pivet showcased biodegradable phone cases. Electric watercraft company Candela unveiled <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-consumer-electronics-show-electric-boats-5a66f29d0b446d6c51c9802dbd96beca">a 28-foot electric speedboat</a>. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/CES-2023-las-vegas-technology-ukraine-14ccd12adab50200c9a1f2f08f2724c2">Ukrainian start-up</a> Melt Water Club presented its water purification method that uses freezing.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The Department of Energy even had a booth — a first, said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, who spoke with The Associated Press ahead of her keynote on Friday.</p><p>Granholm said she is excited about a range of technologies at CES and beyond, from John Deere's newest electronic farm equipment, to battery storage using alternative materials such as sodium salt, both of which she said the Department of Energy has helped fund. </p><p>Granholm also spoke about expanding the use of clean energy, including some forms of hydrogen, fusion and geothermal energy, highlighting the latter as an opportunity for the oil and gas industry. </p><p>"If they’ve used fracking to be able to get to oil and gas, they could be using that same technology to be able to extract the heat beneath our feet,” she said.</p><p>It could be a while before the oil and gas industry walks away from extracting fossil fuels. In the meantime, more companies are taking emissions reductions seriously. And the first step to reducing emissions is having a full understanding of them, said GreenSwapp founder Ajay Varadharajan. The Dutch company intends to help online grocers and food delivery services understand their carbon footprint, including those in their supply chain or “Scope 3” — often the toughest to track.</p><p>Varadharajan wrote an algorithm that pulls information about various edible products from published research papers, which allows him to assign a carbon footprint to every food’s barcode. The algorithm then fine tunes that number with information about a product’s farming techniques and packaging. </p><p>Using GreenSwapp's app, CES attendees could scan the barcode of various milk containers on display to instantly compare their carbon footprint. The company claims this works on any food item with a barcode.</p><p>The information is helpful for conscious consumers, but Varadharajan says the real impact happens when food companies use it to track their emissions. </p><p>Some companies may want to share the information with customers. But he expects many to use it internally, preparing for possible regulations, he explained. The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-business-environment-e55ae33115e6a9e1202673ab51745924">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> is expected to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-government-and-politics-environment-07b736081cf7cd8e46bb40e9834e717e">soon require</a> publicly traded U.S. companies to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions. The largest ones may need to disclose Scope 3 emissions related to their supply chain. Once finalized, the U.S. would join a growing number of countries including the U.K. and Japan that require large companies to disclose this information. The European Union is finalizing reporting standards.</p><p>Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company didn't have a booth this year, but it did demo new tires on vehicles plastered in blue and yellow that rolled around Las Vegas. </p><p>The company currently has the largest market share for replacement consumer tires in the U.S. It says its new demo tire contains 90% sustainable materials, and has improved rolling efficiency, which helps people save energy, even when the tires are on electric vehicles.</p><p>Goodyear didn’t specify how much carbon is reduced in the new tire manufacturing process, or how much energy is saved through rolling efficiency. </p><p>“It's very dependent on the type of vehicle and the type of tire being used,” said CEO Rich Kramer.</p><p>But the company’s line of ingredients appear to move in the right direction. Tires use many materials and this new one transitions away from petroleum products to surplus soybean oil to maintain pliability. It uses silica from rice husk waste residue for grip and fuel efficiency. The list goes on, and Kramer says the tire is an important step toward the company goal of reaching zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>But sourcing these materials in large quantities is an issue, he said. </p><p>“Can you get them at scale to be able to increase production? And then how do you change the manufacturing process for that? That’s a challenge, but a challenge we welcome," he said.</p><p>There’s still some room for improvement in the sourcing of Goodyear's rubber, said Sean Nyquist of Forest Stewardship Council, which works to certify sustainable rubber.</p><p>“In the last 20 years, there’s been significant deforestation as a result of natural rubber,” he said, as demand grew for rubber from trees instead of synthetic versions made in a lab. </p><p>Goodyear’s rubber sourcing follows the guidelines of the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber. Nyquist says this is an important step, but third-party certification would add even more validity to sustainability claims.</p><p>Several tire companies are on a similar path, he said. The tires Pirelli makes for the plug-in version of the BMW X5 have obtained FSC certification, which guarantees rubber was sourced ethically, including forest management and labor practices.</p><p>There may not be a simple path to reducing emissions and building sustainable supply chains. But one place U.S. companies may now get more help is the record federal funding available to decarbonize buildings and transportation through the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/economic-bill-house-vote-be99d8db5bd610c5b1d78bc047a03e77">Inflation Reduction Act</a>. Granholm says she believes the incentives to reduce energy use and scale clean technology are powerful.</p><p>“There’s policy innovation and there’s technology innovation, she said. “We’re all scanning to see what has the best impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and getting to our ultimate goal of saving the planet.”</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Suman Naishadham contributed from Washington. </p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

(Jan. 9) (AP Video: Ted Shaffrey)</p>    <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Thousands of nurses went on strike Monday at two of New York City's major hospitals after contract negotiations stalled over staffing and salaries nearly three years into the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>The privately owned, nonprofit hospitals were <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-new-york-city-manhattan-business-covid-aa271a346234a352bba7abe67638b55b">postponing nonemergency surgeries, diverting ambulances to other medical centers, pulling in temporary staffers,</a> and assigning administrators with nursing backgrounds to work in wards in order to cope with the walkout. </p><p>As many as 3,500 nurses at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx and about 3,600 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan were off the job. Talks were resuming Monday afternoon at Montefiore, but there was no immediate word on when bargaining might resume at Mount Sinai.</p><p>Hundreds of nurses picketed, some singing the chorus from Twisted Sister’s 1984 hit “We’re Not Gonna Take It,” outside Mount Sinai. It was one of many New York hospitals deluged with COVID-19 patients as the virus made the city an epicenter of deaths in spring 2020.</p><p>“We were heroes only two years ago,” said Warren Urquhart, a nurse in transplant and oncology units. “We was on the front lines of the city when everything came to a stop. And now we need to come to a stop so they can understand how much we mean to this hospital and to the patients.”</p><div id="afs:Card:029281580227" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="d81f32cb7ac709404eb795a6d8822b34">Hub peek embed (apf-Health) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>The nurses union, the New York State Nurses Association, said members had to strike because chronic understaffing leaves them caring for too many patients.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Jed Basubas said he generally attends to eight to 10 patients at a time, twice the ideal number in the units where he works. Nurse practitioner Juliet Escalon said she sometimes skips bathroom breaks to attend to patients. So does Ashleigh Woodside, who said her 12-hour operating-room shifts often stretch to 14 hours because short staffing forces her and others to work overtime. </p><p>“We love our job. We want to take care of our patients. But we just want to do it safely and in a humane way, where we feel appreciated,” Woodside said.</p><p>The hospitals said they had offered the same raises — totaling 19% over three years — that the union had accepted at several other <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-manhattan-new-york-city-business-cbd1b3f34d760e016020f316cb0c9d82">facilities where contract talks reached tentative agreements</a> in recent days. </p><div id="8fbb22cafdb64680ad0b4328aba481ca" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Montefiore said it had agreed to add 170 more nurses. Mount Sinai’s administration said the union’s focus on nurse-to-patient ratios “ignores the progress we have made to attract and hire more new nurses, despite a global shortage of healthcare workers that is impacting hospitals across the country.”</p><p>The hospitals said Monday that they had prepared for the strike and were working to minimize the disruption. Mount Sinai called the union's behavior “reckless,” while Montefiore said the strike was sparking “fear and uncertainty across our community." </p><p>“In my opinion, this action was totally unnecessary,” Montefiore President Dr. Philip Ozuah told staffers in a memo Monday afternoon. Ozuah maintained that the two sides had been close to agreement on “a very generous offer.”</p><p>Some patients, meanwhile, were left in limbo. </p><p>Darcy Gervasio took medical leave from her job at a suburban college library, made child care and transportation arrangements, got tests and otherwise prepared for a gastrointestinal surgery that was scheduled Monday but now is postponed indefinitely, she said. While the procedure is considered elective, Gervasio said it's essential to controlling her Crohn’s disease.</p><p>“As a patient, of course, I am annoyed and inconvenienced," she wrote in an email. But Gervasio, a union member herself, said she blames the hospital management, not the nurses. </p><p>“I am very disappointed in the administration for letting the nursing staffing crisis get out of hand in the first place — especially in the wake of the tremendous strain on nurses during the COVID pandemic,” Gervasio wrote. She questioned why Mount Sinai couldn't strike a deal with the union when <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-new-york-city-richmond-access-to-care-business-2efedb700fbecbf1fd6871e7e33425c9">several other local hospitals did</a> in the last two weeks. </p><p>Gov. Kathy Hochul urged the union and the hospitals late Sunday <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-new-york-city-manhattan-strikes-fe2c6865b75099b70949e28f28ccf8e1">to take their dispute to binding arbitration</a>. Montefiore’s administration had said it was willing to let an arbitrator settle the contract; the union did not immediately accept the proposal. In a statement, it said Hochul, a Democrat, “should listen to the frontline COVID nurse heroes and respect our federally-protected labor and collective bargaining rights.”</p><p>A lineup of other city and state Democratic politicians, including Attorney General Letitia James, joined a midday union rally Monday. </p><p>Both hospitals had prepared for the walkout by transferring patients, including intensive-care newborns at Mount Sinai. State Health Department representatives were at the two medical centers Monday to monitor staffing levels, the agency said.</p><p>Montefiore and Mount Sinai are the last of a group of hospitals with nursing contracts that expired simultaneously. The union <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-new-york-city-richmond-strikes-8fbaff93b417ab65abb6fa0bbb2d4217">initially warned that it would strike at all</a> of them at the same time, but the other hospitals reached agreements as the deadline approached. All include raises of 7%, 6%, and 5% over the next three years.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Karen Matthews contributed to this report. </p>]]></description>

Parts of Egypt, including its northern provinces, experienced bad weather Sunday. Traffic in the canal resumed after the ship was refloated and 51 vessels were expected to pass through the waterway in both directions Monday, Rabei's statement added.</p><p>Marwa Maher, a media officer with the canal authority, told The Associated Press the vessel ran aground around 5 a.m. local time and was refloated five hours later.</p><div id="afs:Card:649888627750" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="fc27fee20b14d4017cfdc1bd7b2ffbc9">Hub peek embed (Egypt) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Canal services firm Leth Agencies posted a map that suggested the ship was against the west bank of the canal, pointed south and not wedged across the channel.

            <description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/aa941bfb4b504ec99215b50ae2ebeb7c/3000.jpeg" alt="FILE - Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange in New York, Tuesday, Oct. 4, 2022. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File)" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption><p>FILE - Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange in New York, Tuesday, Oct. 4, 2022. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks were mixed Monday at the start of a week with a few events that could shake markets, including updates on inflation and the health of corporate profits.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.1% after surrendering an early gain of 1.4% in its first trading after closing out its first winning week in the last five. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped nearly 113 points, or 0.3%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 0.6%. </p><p>More stocks rose than fell, and Wall Street's largely positive start to 2023 has come on hopes the Federal Reserve could ease up on its economy-shaking hikes to interest rates as inflation cools. Such rate increases have already slowed parts of the economy sharply, and the fear is more big hikes could cause a painful recession.</p><p>Treasury yields fell further Monday as traders adjust bets for what the Fed will do. They dropped Friday after data showed workers are winning weaker raises than in earlier months. While that's discouraging for workers whose pay is still failing to keep up with rising bills, it could ultimately mean less upward pressure on inflation. </p><p>The next big marker for the market will be Thursday's report on inflation at the consumer level. Economists expect it to show inflation slowed further to 6.5% last month from 7.1% in November. </p><div id="afs:Card:386669778972" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="adddcec61c0b2b377a9a38ccb10d0783">Hub peek embed (Inflation) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>The yield on the two-year Treasury, which tends to track expectations for Fed action, fell to 4.19% from 4.26% late Friday and more than 4.70% in November. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans, fell to 3.52% from 3.57% late Friday.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Lower rates tend to help high-growth and technology stocks in particular, and they were some of the market's leaders Monday. </p><p>Tesla added 5.9%, Nvidia rose 5.2% and Advanced Micro Device climbed 5.1% for some of the biggest gains in the S&amp;P 500. Slightly more stocks in the index rose than fell.</p><p>Altogether, the S&amp;P 500 slipped 2.99 points to 3,982.09. The Dow fell 112.96 to 33,517.65, and the Nasdaq rose 66.36 to 10,635.65.</p><p>Analysts, though, warn more bumpiness is almost surely on the way for the stock market. Even if inflation is slowing, the Fed has pledged to hike rates still further and then to hold them at a high level for a while to make sure the job is done on inflation. </p><p>And parts of the economy that do best when rates are low have already shown signs of sharp pain as the Federal Reserve has hiked its key overnight rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.50% from roughly zero a year ago. </p><p>Warnings are also coming for what look to be lackluster earnings reports from companies, which are contending with higher labor costs and other expenses that eat into their profits. Earnings reporting season is set to kick off on Friday, and this may mark the first year-over-year drop in earnings per share for S&amp;P 500 companies since 2020.</p><p>“With 2022 behind us, investors are now primarily focused on the profit outlook for the coming year,” strategists at Goldman Sachs wrote in a report. </p><p>For the full year of 2023, they see zero growth for S&amp;P 500 earnings per share. And that's if the economy avoids a recession. If a recession does hit, as many on Wall Street suspect, they say earnings could fall 11%. That's key because profits are one of the main levers that set stock prices.</p><p>Some retailers fell Monday after giving financial updates on sales and profitability that disappointed investors. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-new-york-city-043f5381a6b62d9dc941b4041ed6238d">Macy’s</a> dropped 7.7%, and Lululemon Athletica fell 9.3%.</p><p>Stock markets in Europe and Asia gained ground. A Chinese financial news outlet cited a top central bank official as saying that China's more than two-year crackdown on internet companies is nearly finished. </p><p>___</p><p>AP Business Writers Elaine Kurtenbach and Matt Ott contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

Brian Kemp is done being underestimated.</p><p>Having vanquished both a Donald Trump-backed Republican challenger and Democratic star Stacey Abrams to win reelection, Kemp is looking to expand his influence in his second term, free from the caricature of the gun-toting, pickup-driving, migrant-catching country boy that emerged during his first campaign for governor.</p><p>A <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-georgia-governor-nov-10-994a658eafee86843e084bc52beb6866">new vision of Kemp</a> steering his party toward a non-Trumpian conservatism made its debut in his November victory speech after it became clear that he had defeated Abrams by a much larger margin in their rematch than he had in their tight 2018 matchup.</p><p>“This election proves that when Republicans stay focused on real-world solutions that put hardworking people first we can win now, but also in the future, y’all,” Kemp said.</p><p>Kemp pledged that night to “stay in the fight” and followed with concrete steps: He kept his political operation running and lent it to the unsuccessful Senate runoff campaign of Herschel Walker, while forming a federal political action committee that lets the governor influence races for Congress and president. He hasn’t ruled out running for the U.S. Senate in 2026 or even seeking the White House.</p><p>Beyond his own advancement, Kemp’s victory could provide a blueprint for Republicans in competitive states after voters <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-donald-trump-00c770068d8b82f165a9f4871eee983b">rejected many of the Trump-molded candidates</a> in 2022. It’s a less showy approach, aimed at luring independents and moderates while still achieving conservative policy goals.</p><p>“If Republicans looking forward are focused on winning, I think a lot of folks will be calling Gov. Kemp and wanting his advice, but also trying to replicate the things he did here,” said Cody Hall, Kemp’s political adviser.</p><p>Kemp, now 59, was a real estate developer and state senator before Gov. Sonny Perdue appointed him secretary of state in 2010. Eight years later, Kemp was on his way to defeating an establishment candidate for the GOP nomination for governor when Trump’s endorsement supercharged his campaign, which focused on gun rights and opposition to illegal immigration.</p><p>After Kemp defeated Abrams in the 2018 general election by just 1.4 percentage points, she <a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-america-lawsuits-us-news-ap-top-news-elections-7985be43fa4c4422bfece25cb0204307">accused him of using the secretary of state’s office</a> to improperly purge likely Democratic voters. A federal court later rejected legal claims questioning Kemp’s actions.</p><p>In his first term, Kemp logged some big conservative achievements, including <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-north-america-us-news-ap-top-news-courts-cab6dcbdb37341f39fb50f806aca0182">signing stringent abortion limits</a> in 2019. He also made a diverse slate of appointments and kept his promise of $5,000 raises for public school teachers, moves aimed at solidifying his appeal to the middle in an anticipated Abrams rematch.</p><div id="afs:Card:960119917770" content-id="65049bc27c3c2f5e197feaf15d1f031a" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout </div><p>Kemp’s relationship with Trump began to deteriorate after the governor appointed Kelly Loeffler to the Senate instead of Trump’s preferred pick. Trump later <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-sc-state-wire-virus-outbreak-politics-health-a031d395d414ffa655fdc65e6760d6a0">took shots at Kemp</a> over his decision to reopen businesses early in the COVID-19 pandemic, and the president’s rage boiled over when Kemp refused to help Trump and his allies overturn Joe Biden’s narrow victory in Georgia in the 2020 election — efforts that are now the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-4a2cd9693dfded229332210b85661bc9">subject of investigations</a> by state and federal prosecutors.</p><p>Trump vowed revenge against Kemp, but the governor pressed forward. In 2021, Kemp <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-legislature-bills-state-elections-voting-rights-b2b014cc81894a50fc513168a5f1d0b8">signed into law</a> a sweeping Republican-sponsored overhaul of state elections inspired by Trump’s false claims of fraud in the 2020 election. He also pushed through a bill loosening gun laws.</p><p>Trump endorsed former Sen. David Perdue as a primary challenger to the governor. Kemp, who never publicly challenged Trump or even responded directly to his tirades, ended up crushing Perdue in the primary. In the meantime, his distance from Trump provided Kemp with credibility among independents and even some Democrats.</p><p>“It’s just given him a gravitas you can’t buy,” said Brian Robinson, a Republican political consultant.</p><p>Even some Democrats acknowledge Kemp’s increasing political strength after his nearly 8 percentage-point victory over Abrams. State Rep. Al Williams, long close to Abrams, said Kemp is “at the height of his powers” going into a second term. His inauguration is Thursday. </p><p>Williams and other backers say that Kemp’s incumbency, plus the billions in federal COVID-19 aid that he alone decided how to spend under Georgia law, were factors in his win. “He spent it very effectively and spread the net wide," Williams said.</p><p>As the Senate race <a href="https://apnews.com/article/georgia-senate-race-runoff-2022-midterms-b32e84784e9e644b3e3163b7ca9cc569">turned to overtime</a>, Kemp was called on to help Walker in his runoff against Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock. Kemp, who had secured GOP donors and built his own political organization independent from a state party run by Trump acolytes, turned over his voter data operation to allow the Walker campaign to tailor messages to different factions of Republican voters.</p><p>Still, Kemp largely maintained his distance from Walker, whose campaign was beset by accusations that he had <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-2022-midterm-elections-herschel-walker-health-georgia-1a7c86004f571ea10e6f88ea375b439d">paid for abortions</a>, behaved <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-sports-nfl-college-football-coronavirus-pandemic-5e2875eec11e93f9a3bf1fc859137ff8">violently toward women</a> and lied about his education, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-college-football-entertainment-sports-bb1ef7d866ab99302974cce1816efb65">work history</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/herschel-walker-nfl-georgia-senate-704738fdbed64383e25e3435684d7341">personal background</a>. Shortly before the runoff, Kemp agreed to appear in a television ad endorsing Walker but made sure that it was his own political team that wrote the script.</p><p>Steven Law, who leads the political action committee aligned with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, said Kemp did what savvy political heavyweights do: He helped his party while establishing and protecting his own brand. </p><p>“We’ve had a party where Trump has had a decisive gravitational pull, and here’s a person in Brian Kemp who just stayed apart from that orbit, made his own calls, decided things his way — not in opposition to Trump, but at the same time not in obedience to him,” Law said, calling Kemp’s balancing act “remarkable.” </p><p>Kemp’s future political path remains unclear, but he has options. </p><p>In Georgia, he’s never been identified as having open national ambitions, either for the presidency or Senate, and Robinson noted that Kemp “has never spoken of Washington fondly.”</p><p>Law demurred when asked whether McConnell or his team has broached the possibility of Kemp running for the Senate in 2026, when Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff would face voters again.</p><p>There’s also the possibility of a vice presidential bid or a future Cabinet post. Perhaps most likely is a larger role in the Republican Governors Association: He’s now on the RGA’s executive committee and could become chair in 2025 or 2026. </p><p>Hall said Kemp wants to help other states elect conservatives who advocate “freedom and liberty and personal responsibility” while promoting education, a strong economy and good jobs. “Whatever he can do to help more folks like that get elected, I’m sure he will,” Hall said. </p><p>At home, Kemp is the paramount party leader and unchallenged boss of state government in a way that’s new for him. With a new House speaker and lieutenant governor leading the General Assembly, Kemp is unlikely to meet resistance from GOP majorities. </p><p>So far, though, he’s offered a minimalist second-term agenda: income tax and property tax rebates, some criminal justice measures and minor education changes. His biggest promise is continuity, adding four more years to 20 years of Republican rule in Georgia.</p><p>The governor could also take firmer control of GOP machinery if he backs an effort to push out Georgia Republican Chair David Shafer, a Trump ally. </p><p>“He is carrying around bags of political capital like the Monopoly man,” Robinson said, marveling at what he calls Kemp’s “clear and very empowering” mandates from the primary and general election. “Go ahead and put a monocle and top hat on him.”</p>]]></description>

(Jan. 9) (AP video/Eduardo François)</p>    <p>RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Brazilian authorities said Monday that they were looking into who may have been behind the shocking uprising that sent protesters storming into the nation’s halls of power in a riot that had striking similarities to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.</p><p>In an unprecedented display for Latin America's largest nation, thousands of supporters of ex-President Jair Bolsonaro swarmed into Congress, the Supreme Court and the presidential palace on Sunday. Many of them said they wanted the Brazilian army to restore the far-right Bolsonaro to power and oust the newly inaugurated leftist president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.</p><p>Also on Monday, police broke down a pro-Bolsonaro encampment outside a military building and detained some 1,200 people there, the justice ministry’s press office told The Associated Press. The federal police press office said the force already plans to indict roughly 1,000 people.</p><p>Lula and the heads of the Supreme Court, Senate and Lower House signed a letter that denounced the attack and said were taking legal measures.</p><p>Justice Minister Flávio Dino told reporters that police have begun tracking those who paid for the buses that transported protesters to the capital. Speaking Monday at a news conference, he said rioters apparently intended for their displays to create a domino effect nationwide, and that they could be charged with a range of offenses, including organized crime, staging a coup and violent abolition of the democratic rule of law.</p><p>“We think that the worst is over," Dino said, adding that the government is now focused on punishing lawbreakers and those who enabled them. “We cannot and will not compromise in fulfilling our legal duties, because this fulfillment is essential so such events do not repeat themselves.”</p><p>Rioters wearing the green and yellow of the national flag broke windows, toppled furniture and hurled computers and printers to the ground. They punched holes in a massive Emiliano Di Cavalcanti painting at the presidential palace and destroyed other works of art. They overturned the U-shaped table where Supreme Court justices convene, ripped a door off one justice's office and vandalized a statue outside the court. The buildings' interiors were left in ruins.</p><p>Monday's detainments came in addition to the 300 people who were arrested Sunday during the riot.</p><p>Police were noticeably slow to react — even after the arrival of more than 100 buses — leading many to question whether authorities had either simply ignored numerous warnings, underestimated the protesters' strength or been somehow complicit.</p><p>Prosecutors in the capital said local security forces were negligent at the very least. A supreme court justice temporarily suspended the regional governor. Another justice blamed authorities for not swiftly cracking down on budding neofascism in Brazil.</p><p>After his Oct. 30 electoral defeat, Bolsonaro, who has gone to Florida, has been stoking belief among his hardcore supporters that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-caribbean-brazil-b7c872b541371ff2925fae793007af87">the nation's electronic voting system was prone to fraud,</a> though he never presented any evidence. His lawmaker son Eduardo Bolsonaro held several meetings with former U.S. President Donald Trump, Trump's longtime ally Steve Bannon and his senior campaign adviser, Jason Miller.</p><p>By early afternoon Monday, the remaining Bolsonaro supporters dissipated as word spread that he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-florida-state-government-brazil-099db80c6511119b534ca17747f871fe">was hospitalized in Florida with abdominal pain</a>. His condition wasn’t clear, but a photo published by Brazilian newspaper O Globo showed him smiling from a hospital bed. He has been hospitalized multiple times since surviving a stabbing in 2018. A hospital spokesperson did not immediately respond to a phone call and text message.</p><p>In a joint statement issued from Mexico City, U.S. President Joe Biden, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned the attack "on Brazil’s democracy and on the peaceful transfer of power.”</p><p>Results from Brazil's election — the closest in over three decades — were quickly recognized by politicians across the spectrum, including some Bolsonaro allies, as well as dozens of governments. And Bolsonaro surprised nearly everyone by promptly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-caribbean-rio-de-janeiro-e4328ee88323100cdaa1e4e461006cce">fading from view</a>. He neither conceded defeat nor emphatically cried fraud, though he and his party submitted a request to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-caribbean-brazil-c03ec4f0e1d65fc81c02a2d90181cf48">nullify millions of votes</a> that was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-caribbean-brazil-90bf6942d59fde9707c2f7b7e6bd72c4">swiftly dismissed.</a></p><p>Since 1996, Brazilians have used an electronic voting system that security experts consider less secure than hand-marked paper ballots because the system leaves no auditable paper trail. But Brazil’s system is closely scrutinized, and domestic authorities and international observers have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-caribbean-voting-donald-trump-elections-fb592d5165e5bb07c0426199d86b5787">never found evidence of it being exploited to commit fraud.</a></p><p>Still, Bolsonaro's supporters refused to accept the results. They blocked roads and remained camped outside military buildings, urging the armed forces to intervene.</p><p>Dino, the justice minister, referred to the encampments as incubators of terrorism. Protests were overwhelmingly peaceful, but <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-caribbean-rio-de-janeiro-e4328ee88323100cdaa1e4e461006cce">isolated threats</a> — including a bomb found on a fuel truck headed to Brasilia’s airport — prompted security concerns.</p><p>Two days before Lula's Jan. 1 inauguration, Bolsonaro flew to the U.S. and took up temporary residence in Orlando. Many Brazilians expressed relief that, while he declined to participate in the transition of power, his absence allowed it to occur without incident. </p><p>Or so it had been, until Sunday's havoc. </p><p>Analysts told the AP that the upheaval could yield greater political support for Lula and his stated mission to pacify the polarized country. Many right-wing citizens and politicians were repulsed by Sunday's scenes and eager to distance themselves from far-right radicalism. The leader of Bolsonaro's own party called the uprising “an embarrassment.”</p><p>“This may have been the beginning of the end. The political system will want to isolate that radical movement and move away from it,” said Mario Sérgio Lima, political analyst at Medley Advisors. “I think what we will see now is the right trying to create new alternatives and new leaders, and the center distancing itself.”</p><p>In a news conference from Sao Paulo state, Lula read a freshly signed decree for the federal government to assume control of security in the federal district. He said that the so-called “fascist fanatics,” as well as those who financed their activities, must be punished. He also accused Bolsonaro of encouraging the uprising.</p><p>Bolsonaro repudiated the president's accusation late Sunday. Writing on Twitter, he said peaceful protest is part of democracy, but vandalism and invasion of public buildings are “exceptions to the rule.”</p><p>Unlike the 2021 attack in the U.S., few officials would have been working in the top government buildings on a Sunday. And videos showed limited presence of the capital’s military police.</p><p>One video showed a group of protesters easily pushing through a police barricade, with only a few officers using pepper spray. Another showed officers standing by as protesters stormed the Congress, including one using his phone to record what was happening.</p><p>“This was a gross error by the federal district's government,” said Thiago de Aragão, director of strategy at Brasilia-based politican consultancy Arko Advice. “Everyone knew they (the protesters) were coming to Brasilia. The expectation was that the federal district's government was going to mount a response to protect the capital. They didn't do any of that."</p><p>Lula said at his news conference that there was “incompetence or bad faith" on the part of police, and he promised that some would be punished.</p><p>Federal District Gov. Ibaneis Rocha confirmed on Twitter that he had fired the capital city’s head of public security, Anderson Torres, hours before a Supreme Court justice suspended the governor from office, alleging “intentional omission.”</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press Writer Carla Bridi contributed from Salvador.</p>]]></description>

(Novo Nordisk via AP)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>Children struggling with obesity should be evaluated and treated early and aggressively, including with medications for kids as young as 12 and surgery for those as young as 13, according to new guidelines released Monday.</p><p>The longstanding practice of “watchful waiting," or delaying treatment to see whether children and teens outgrow or overcome obesity on their own only worsens the problem that affects more than 14.4 million young people in the U.S. Left untreated, obesity can lead to lifelong health problems, including high blood pressure, diabetes and depression. </p><p>"Waiting doesn’t work,” said Dr. Ihuoma Eneli, co-author of the first <a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2022-060640/190443/Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-the-Evaluation-and?autologincheck=redirected">guidance on childhood obesity</a> in 15 years from the American Academy of Pediatrics. “What we see is a continuation of weight gain and the likelihood that they’ll have (obesity) in adulthood.” </p><p>For the first time, the group's guidance sets ages at which kids and teens should be offered medical treatments such as drugs and surgery — in addition to intensive diet, exercise and other behavior and lifestyle interventions, said Eneli, director of the Center for Healthy Weight and Nutrition at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.</p><p>In general, doctors should offer adolescents 12 and older who have obesity access to appropriate drugs and teens 13 and older with severe obesity referrals for weight-loss surgery, though situations may vary. </p><div id="afs:Card:029281580227" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="c48d5896114beea7eda31d7b8b25461d">Hub peek embed (apf-Health) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The guidelines aim to reset the inaccurate view of obesity as “a personal problem, maybe a failure of the person’s diligence,” said Dr. Sandra Hassink, medical director for the AAP Institute for Healthy Childhood Weight, and a co-author of the guidelines. </p><p>“This is not different than you have asthma and now we have an inhaler for you,” Hassink said. </p><p>Young people who have a body mass index that meets or exceeds the 95th percentile for kids of the same age and gender are considered obese. Kids who reach or exceed that level by 120% are considered to have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-chicago-obesity-children-686ed01aa71103aa9e2848f5a704d07d">severe obesity</a>. BMI is a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/index.html">measure of body size</a> based on a calculation of height and weight. </p><p>Obesity affects nearly 20% of kids and teens in the U.S. and about 42% of adults, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p><p>The group's guidance takes into consideration that obesity is a biological problem and that the condition is a complex, chronic disease, said Aaron Kelly, co-director of the Center for Pediatric Obesity Medicine at the University of Minnesota.</p><p>“Obesity is not a lifestyle problem. It is not a lifestyle disease,” he said. “It predominately emerges from biological factors.”</p><p>The guidelines come as new drug treatments for obesity in kids have emerged, including approval late last month of Wegovy, a weekly injection, for use in children ages 12 and older. Different doses of the drug, called semaglutide, are also used under different names to treat diabetes. <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2208601">A recent study</a> published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that Wegovy, made by Novo Nordisk, helped teens reduce their BMI by about 16% on average, better than the results in adults. </p><p>Within days of the Dec. 23 authorization, pediatrician Dr. Claudia Fox had prescribed the drug for one of her patients, a 12-year-old girl. </p><p>“What it offers patients is the possibility of even having an almost normal body mass index,” said Fox, also a weight management specialist at the University of Minnesota. “It’s like a whole different level of improvement.” </p><p>The drug affects how the pathways between the brain and the gut regulate energy, said Dr. Justin Ryder, an obesity researcher at Lurie Children’s Hospital in Chicago.</p><p>“It works on how your brain and stomach communicate with one another and helps you feel more full than you would be,” he said. </p><p>Still, specific doses of semaglutide and other anti-obesity drugs have been hard to get because of recent shortages caused by manufacturing problems and high demand, spurred in part by celebrities on TikTok and other social media platforms boasting about enhanced weight loss. </p><p>In addition, many insurers won’t pay for the medication, which costs about $1,300 a month. “I sent the prescription yesterday,” Fox said. “I’m not holding my breath that insurance will cover it.”</p><p>One expert in pediatric obesity cautioned that while kids with obesity must be treated early and intensively, he worries that some doctors may turn too quickly to drugs or surgery. </p><p>“It’s not that I’m against the medications,” said Dr. Robert Lustig, a longtime specialist in pediatric endocrinology at the University of California, San Francisco. “I’m against the willy-nilly use of those medications without addressing the cause of the problem.” </p><p>Lustig said children must be evaluated individually to understand all of the factors that contribute to obesity. He has long blamed too much sugar for the rise in obesity. He urges a sharp focus on diet, particularly ultraprocessed foods that are high in sugar and low in fiber.</p><p>Dr. Stephanie Byrne, a pediatrician at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, said she'd like more research about the drug’s efficacy in a more diverse group of children and about potential long-term effects before she begins prescribing it regularly. </p><p>“I would want to see it be used on a little more consistent basis,” she said. “And I would have to have that patient come in pretty frequently to be monitored.” </p><p>At the same time, she welcomed the group's new emphasis on prompt, intensive treatment for obesity in kids. </p><p>“I definitely think this is a realization that diet and exercise is not going to do it for a number of teens who are struggling with this – maybe the majority,” she said.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Jalen Hurts walked into the Linc wearing a <a href="https://twitter.com/Eagles/status/1612157790579220480">Michael Jordan “I’m Back” T-shirt</a> from the former Chicago Bulls’ star’s first unretirement. </p><p>Yeah, Hurts is back — and now, so are the Eagles as a Super Bowl threat.</p><p>Hurts returned from a sprained right shoulder and threw for 229 yards under a conservative game plan, and the Philadelphia Eagles clinched the No. 1 seed in the NFC with a 22-16 win over the New York Giants on Sunday night.</p><p>“It's really tough being out,' Hurts said. ”I was pushing myself to be available and it wasn’t an easy thing."</p><p>Hurts wasn't asked to do much against New York's B-team — with the Giants' No. 6 seed already secured, they rested the bulk of their starting lineup — and he won without the explosive plays, the head-first rushes on fourth down, the scrambles that turn into 20-yard gains, the type of breakout plays that had defined his season. They weren't needed.</p><p>His mere presence was the emotional boost the Eagles needed after the stumbles each of the last two weeks.</p><p>The Eagles rebounded from two straight losses behind backup QB Gardner Minshew to clinch the NFC East, the top spot in the conference and home field throughout the playoffs. The team also gets a bye, one more pivotal week of rest for Hurts.</p><div id="afs:Card:234821764243" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="a80233e214f9e1b60db676bd2e5b6342">Hub peek embed (NFL) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Hurts received a roaring ovation and “MVP!” chants as he ran out of the tunnel during pregame introductions. The Eagles had clearly missed their QB, who had grown into an MVP front-runner until he was hurt on a hard tackle against Chicago.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Hurts was 20-of-35 passing in a game that had a preseason feel — the Eagles were only 1 of 5 in the red zone — and played the entire game. The Eagles also earned the No. 1 seed in the 2017 season and won the Super Bowl. They have 5-1 odds to win it this year, per <a href="https://sportsbook.fanduel.com/navigation/nfl?tab=super-bowl">FanDuel Sportsbook</a>, trailing only Kansas City and Buffalo.</p><p>Hurts completed a 35-yard pass to A.J. Brown on the Eagles’ first play of the game and showed no ill-effects from the sprained right shoulder suffered three weeks ago. The Eagles played at half-speed against the Giants backups and refused to risk Hurts’ health — they did not have a called rushing play for him. The dynamic QB that ran for 747 yards and 13 touchdowns entering the game mostly stayed in the pocket, the Eagles clearly wary Hurts could take another hard hit on his shoulder.</p><p>“I know he was hurting,” Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said. “He was hurting bad.”</p><p>The Eagles didn’t get much offensively but really didn’t have to against a Giants (9-7-1) team that had already secured the No. 6 seed in the NFC and rested the bulk of their starters. Saquon Barkley and his 1,312 yards rushing took a seat. So did starting QB Daniel Jones.</p><p>The Giants, who play at Minnesota next Sunday, instead passed over No. 2 QB Tyrod Taylor and started practice squad regular Davis Webb.</p><p>Webb, in his first career start, rushed for a 14-yard touchdown in the fourth that made it 19-9. He tossed a 25-yard TD pass to Kenny Golladay late in the fourth that made it 22-16. He threw for 168 yards on 23-of-40 passing.</p><p>Hurts, whose 35 total touchdowns this season tied the franchise record set by Randall Cunningham in 1990, had a TD pass in the third quarter wiped out because of a penalty and then threw his sixth interception of the season on the next play.</p><p>This game for the Eagles was all about stabilizing themselves and reclaiming the swagger and confidence they had earlier this season as they steamrolled behind Hurts to a 13-1 record. Hurts likely wouldn’t have played had the Eagles beaten either Dallas or New Orleans in each of the last games and clinched the No. 1 seed. Instead, it was the Eagles playing with everything to lose while the nine-win Giants were secure in their spot.</p><p>“It’s the NFL, so the guys you have on the team, you have confidence in,” Giants rookie coach Brian Daboll said. “I thought our guys competed all the way to the end.”</p><p>Jake Elliott kicked field goals of 32, 52 and 39 yards in the first half. Boston Scott ran for an 8-yard touchdown — a whopping 10 of his 17 career TDs are against the Giants — and the Eagles took a 16-0 lead into halftime.</p><p>Elliott added field goals of 54 and 22 yards in the second half. Graham Gano kicked a 24-yarder in the third for the Giants.</p><p>RECORD DAY</p><p>Brown had four catches for 95 yards and finished with 1,496 for the team’s season record. Mike Quick held the yards receiving mark of 1,409 in 1983 in the 16-game season. </p><p>“It means a lot to leave my footprint on this organization," Brown said. “There were a lot of great receivers before me. For me to do it the first year, it means the world. I told Mike thank you for everything he has done for the game.”</p><p>Quick is a radio analyst for the Eagles. “Just as he told me before the game, he said the first pass is going to come to me and I’m going to break your record,” he said.</p><p>DeVonta Smith set the Eagles’ season record for receptions with 95 (and 1,196 yards receiving). He had seven receptions against the Giants. Irving Fryar had 88 catches in 1996.</p><p>The 14 wins are also the most in a season for the Eagles.</p><p>UP NEXT</p><p>Eagles: enjoy the spoils of an off week.</p><p>Giants: head to Minnesota to play the Vikings next Sunday. </p><p>___</p><p>AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Adrian Kraus)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — The echoes of “Let’s Go Buffalo!” pregame chants were still reverberating through an emotionally charged Bills stadium <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-england-patriots-buffalo-bills-sports-nfl-football-damar-hamlin-47dc11b56ec33560542cd3847db4de45">celebrating injured safety Damar Hamlin</a>, when another roar suddenly erupted as Nyheim Hines returned the opening kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown.</p><p>Some three hours later, and after Hines returned another kickoff 101 yards for a go-ahead score in a 35-23 win over the New England Patriots, the fans were on their feet chanting “Hamlin! Hamlin! Hamlin!” and Bills players holding up three fingers in honor of the injured safety's No. 3 jersey.</p><p>Whatever questions the Bills faced regarding being capable of playing six days after being left stunned and saddened as they watched Hamlin being resuscitated on the field in Cincinnati were <a href="https://twitter.com/BuffaloBills/status/1612148627904032768?s=20&amp;t=fKwH7nv_LBo0TZ0nMzwEew">answered before the game was 14 seconds old</a>.</p><p>“I can’t remember a play that touched me like that I don’t think in my life. It’s probably No. 1,” quarterback Josh Allen said. “It’s just spiritual. ... You can’t draw that one up or write that one up any better.”</p><p>“OMFG!!!!!!” Hamlin posted on his Twitter account from his hospital bed at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, where he has spent the week progressively recovering. </p><div id="afs:Card:234821764243" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="25243cdf2ceb3780419859fc39537ef4">Hub peek embed (NFL) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“HINES FREE” he tweeted again after <a href="https://twitter.com/BuffaloBills/status/1612178325266653184?s=20&amp;t=egEijZwa6gRPpbbI15Xy_Q">Hines’ second score.</a> Coach Sean McDermott said the team reached Hamlin by phone and had him count down the team's final huddle in the locker room.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Acquired by Buffalo in a trade with Indianapolis two months ago, Hines became the NFL’s 11th player to return two kickoffs for scores in a game, and first since Seattle’s Leon Washington in 2010.</p><p>“We as a community, I feel like we needed this win,” Hines said before recalling the message Hamlin's father, Mario, delivered to the team on Wednesday in urging them to play. “He said, that’s what Damar wanted, he would want us to push forward, and to win against New England.” </p><p>While Hines sparked the win, much of the Bills focus remained on the 24-year-old Hamlin, who addressed the team by videoconference on Friday, in which he told them: “Love you boys.”</p><p>Bills cornerback Tre’Davious White, who at times this season questioned if he’d ever recover from a knee injury sustained in November 2021, had difficulty holding back his emotions after earning <a href="https://twitter.com/BuffaloBills/status/1612175526617305088?s=20&amp;t=SuwtVWQzo-2i0qZhv2Xqjg">his first interception</a> of the season.</p><p>Apologizing for using a profanity in referring to how difficult last week was, White noted how Hamlin texted his defensive secondary teammates by apologizing for what he put them through emotionally.</p><p>“For him to check on us?” White said. “I just want to hug the (heck) out of him.”</p><p>Bills receiver John Brown, who scored on a 42-yard touchdown, <a href="https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1612185227044196352?s=20&amp;t=NB4g8nxGufHEU-hScLzQ6g">honored assistant trainer Denny Kellington</a> by handing him the ball. It was Kellington who is credited for his quick on-field response in performing CPR to get Hamlin’s heart beating again.</p><p>In the past year filled with adversity striking Buffalo, from a deadly snowstorm over Christmas to a fatal mass-shooting at a supermarket in May, the Bills showed their resilience by uplifting their community. Overcoming the sudden shock and mental distress of Hamlin collapsing on the field, the win secured Buffalo (13-3) the AFC’s No. 2 seed.</p><p>The Bills will now host their division rival Dolphins in the wild-card round next Sunday.</p><p>The loss, coupled with Miami beating the New York Jets, eliminated the Patriots (8-9) from the playoffs for the second time in three years, and just the fourth time in 23 seasons during Bill Belichick’s coaching tenure. </p><p>And leave it to receiver Stefon Diggs, who made a point to visit Hamlin in the University of Cincinnati Medical Center immediately following the game in Cincinnati was suspended, to seal the victory with a 49-yard touchdown catch from Allen to put Buffalo ahead 35-23 with 8:51 remaining.</p><p>The sold-out crowd — many of them wearing No. 3 Hamlin shirts and jerseys, and holding up red hearts in the player’s honor — erupted as one as Allen walked off the field with his hands raised.</p><p>On the ensuing kickoff, which went for a touchback, Bills special teams players all raced into the end zone and motioned to the crowd. The fans, as one, stood up and let out a massive roar.</p><p>Allen finished 19 of 31 for 254 yards with three touchdowns and an interception.</p><p>The Patriots needed only a win to clinch a playoff berth, but wound up stumbling in closing the season by losing five of their last seven.</p><p>“Proud of the way our guys competed and prepared. In the end, collectively, players, coaches, we just weren’t good enough today,” said Belichick, whose 19 playoff appearances remain tied with Don Shula on the NFL coaching list. </p><p>“Today we missed some opportunities, and gave up four big plays. Those were the things that made a difference in the game.”</p><p>Mac Jones finished 26 of 40 for 243 yards and three touchdowns, including two to DeVante Parker, and three interceptions — all coming in the second half.</p><p>Jones’ final two interceptions came on consecutive drives in the final six minutes.</p><p>Facing third-and-19 at the Buffalo 22, Jones’ deep pass over the middle went off the hand of tight end Hunter Henry, and was picked off by linebacker Matt Milano.</p><p>On New England’s next possession, Jones’ pass went off the hands of Damien Harris, and into the hands of linebacker Tremaine Edmunds.</p><p>MILESTONE</p><p>Patriots defensive back Devin McCourty had an interception and recovered Devin Singletary’s fumble. The interception was the 35th of McCourty’s 13-year career, moving him one behind Ty Law and Raymond Clayborn, who are tied for first on the franchise list.</p><p>The 35-year-old McCourty made his 205th start for New England in what could be his final game for the franchise.</p><p>INJURIES</p><p>Patriots DT DaMarcus Mitchell did not return after sustaining a concussion.</p><p>UP NEXT</p><p>The Bills host the Dolphins at 1 p.m. EST next Sunday.</p><p>___</p><p>AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL </p>]]></description>

They also give the conservative Freedom Caucus more seats on the committee that decides which legislation reaches the House floor. </p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="4922d22689eb79d5d05c1b49ca733123">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>They also raise questions about whether McCarthy can garner enough support from Republicans, who hold a 222-212 edge, on a critical vote in the coming months to raise the debt limit, given conservatives' demand that there also be significant spending cuts, over opposition from the White House and a Democratic-controlled Senate.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., a strong McCarthy supporter, said she currently is “on the fence” about the proposed rules.</p><p>“I like the rules package,” Mace said, in reference to what has been released publicly. “What I don’t support is a small number of people trying to get a deal done or deals done for themselves in private, in secret.”</p><p>She said it will be hard to get anything done in the House if a small band is given a stronger hand compared with the larger number of moderates. “I am concerned that commonsense legislation will not get through to get a vote on the floor," she said.</p><p>Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, was an outright “no” against the rules package, decrying an “insurgency caucus” that he said would cut defense spending and push extremist legislation, such as on immigration. </p><p>Democrats are expected to be united against the package.</p><p>Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a member of the Freedom Caucus who is expected to lead the House Judiciary Committee, defended the concessions McCarthy made and said he believes the rules package will get enough Republican support to pass. He insisted that the agreements will help ensure broader representation on committees and will curtail unfettered government spending. </p><p>“We'll see tomorrow,” he said Sunday, but “I think we’ll get the 218 votes needed to pass the rules package."</p><p>In the coming months, Congress will have to work to raise the debt limit before the government reaches its borrowing cap or face a devastating default on payments, including those for Social Security, military troops and federal benefits such as food assistance. Lawmakers will also have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-ukraine-government-us-republican-party-health-care-costs-13f3f7bfed22bda0cbf73002d9fec273">to fund federal agencies and programs</a> for the next budget year, which begins Oct. 1.</p><p>“Our general concern is that the dysfunction — that was historic — that we saw this week is not at an end, it’s just the beginning,” said <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nancy-pelosi-hakeem-jeffries-congress-government-and-politics-e6dee438b2cfd776b70ff29495072ab5">House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries</a> of New York.</p><p>The White House has rejected Republican calls to slash spending in return for an increase in the federal government’s borrowing authority. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre went so far on Sunday as to call House Republicans’ likely demands “hostage taking” that would risk default, an event that could trigger an economic crisis.</p><p>“Congress is going to need to raise the debt limit without — without — conditions and it’s just that simple,” Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-united-states-government-mexico-el-paso-2e30ea26bbc55c7af509a6e60ad3d33c?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=TopNews&amp;utm_campaign=position_02">President Joe Biden flew to Texas</a>. “Attempts to exploit the debt ceiling as leverage will not work. There will be no hostage taking.”</p><p>Yet the White House also said it had no plans to sidestep the needed congressional approval through possible budget gimmicks such as the minting of a coin to help cover a deficit that could be roughly $1 trillion this fiscal year.</p><p>“We’re not considering any measures that would go around Congress,” Jean-Pierre said. “That’s not what we’re doing. This is a fundamental congressional responsibility, and Congress must act.”</p><p>Jordan argued that “everything has to be on the table” when it comes to spending cuts, including in defense, in light of the government's $32 trillion debt. “Frankly we better look at the money we send to Ukraine as well and say, how can we best spend the money to protect America?” he said.</p><p>Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, one of the 20 who initially voted against McCarthy before throwing his support behind the Californian, said he and other conservatives will be holding their position that there should be spending cuts in a debt ceiling bill. Asked whether he would exercise members' new authority and unilaterally initiate a vote to remove the speaker if McCarthy doesn't ultimately agree, Roy offered a warning.</p><p> “I’m not going to play the ‘what if’ games on how we’re going to use the tools of the House to make sure that we enforce the terms of the agreement, but we will use the tools of the House to enforce the terms of the agreement,” Roy said.</p><p>Mace and Gonzales appeared on CBS' “Face the Nation,” Jordan spoke on “Fox News Sunday,” Jeffries was on NBC's “Meet the Press,” and Roy was on CNN's “State of the Union.”</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Josh Boak contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

In addition, a 6-year-old is too young to be committed to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice if found guilty.</p><p>A juvenile judge would have authority, though, to revoke a parent’s custody and place a child under the purview of the Department of Social Services.</p><p>Mayor Phillip Jones would not say where the boy is being held.</p><p>“We are ensuring he has all the services that he currently needs right now,” Jones said Saturday.</p><p>Experts who study gun violence said the shooting represents an extremely rare occurrence of a young child bringing a gun into school and wounding a teacher.</p><p>“It’s very rare and it’s not something the legal system is really designed or positioned to deal with,” said researcher David Riedman, founder of a database that tracks U.S. school shootings dating back to 1970.</p><p>He said Saturday that he’s only aware of three other shootings caused by 6-year-old students in the time period he’s studied. Those include the fatal shooting of a fellow student in 2000 in Michigan and shootings that injured other students in 2011 in Texas and 2021 in Mississippi.</p><p>Riedman said he only knows of one other instance of a student younger than that causing gunfire at a school, in which a 5-year-old student brought a gun to a Tennessee school in 2013 and accidentally discharged it. No one was injured in that case.</p><p>Newport News is a city of about 185,000 people in southeastern Virginia known for its shipyard, which builds the nation’s aircraft carriers and other U.S. Navy vessels.</p><p>Richneck has about 550 students in kindergarten through fifth grade, according to the Virginia Department of Education’s website. Jones said there will be no classes at the school Monday and Tuesday.</p>]]></description>

The cause of death was under investigation but was not considered to be suspicious. (Jan. 8)</p>    <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) — Adam Rich, the child actor with a pageboy mop-top who charmed TV audiences as “America’s little brother” on “Eight is Enough,” has died. He was 54. </p><p>Rich died Saturday at his home in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles, said Lt. Aimee Earl of the Los Angeles County Medical-Examiner Coroner’s office. The cause of death was under investigation but was not considered to be suspicious.</p><p>Rich had a limited acting career after starring at age 8 as Nicholas Bradford, the youngest of eight children, on the ABC hit dramedy that ran from from 1977 to 1981. </p><p>Betty Buckley, who played his stepmother on the show, said <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CnK_JNCu-RD/">on Instagram that</a> she was shocked to learn of his death Sunday and referred to Rich as a “light," her “young pal” on set and friend ever since.</p><p>"I adored him and loved working with him," said Buckley, who posted photos from the show of the two of them together on a swing set, on horseback and with her arm around him while he was sleeping. “He was so sweet, funny, fresh and natural. He brought a lot of joy to all of us on the show and to our audiences.”</p><p>Rich’s public life after stardom was similar to that other child actors whose promising careers are later derailed by drugs and alcohol, and run-ins with the law.</p><div id="afs:Card:958899307023" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="7294e6bf8061f6c12604c2716d34b722">Hub peek embed (apf-entertainment) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>He was arrested for driving under the influence in 2002 after nearly striking a parked California Highway Patrol cruiser in a freeway lane closed for maintenance. He was arrested in April 1991 for attempting to break into a pharmacy and in October of that year for allegedly stealing a drug-filled syringe at a hospital where he was being treated for a dislocated shoulder. </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Rich suffered from a type of depression that defied treatment and he had tried to erase the stigma of talking about mental illness, said publicist Danny Deraney. He unsuccessfully tried experimental cures over the years.</p><p>Deraney said he and others close to Rich were worried in recent weeks when they couldn’t reach him.</p><p>“He was just a very kind, generous, loving soul,” Deraney told The Associated Press. “Being a famous actor is not necessarily what he wanted to be. ... He had no ego, not an ounce of it.”</p><div id="8482dfff39ff46c3a859756dd9f601e1" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Rich discussed his mental health on Twitter and noted in October that he'd been sober for seven years. He said he wasn't perfect — referring to arrests, many stints in rehab, several overdoses and “countless detoxes (and) relapses" — and urged his nearly 19,000 followers to never give up. </p><p>“Human beings weren’t built to endure mental illness,” Rich tweeted in September. “The mere fact that some people consider those to be weak, or have a lack of will is totally laughable … because it’s the total opposite! It’s takes a very, very strong person … a warrior if you will … to battle such illnesses.”</p><p>Rich posted a picture of himself from his heyday with one-time child star Mickey Rooney.</p><p>“Everyone used to say to me, ‘You are the modern day Mickey Rooney,’” he tweeted. “But when Mickey Rooney told me that himself, it meant a helluva a lot more to me!”</p><p>Nearly 27 years ago, Rich participated in a hoax that Might magazine created about the actor getting killed in a robbery outside a Los Angeles nightclub in 1996. The article for the little-known magazine was intended as a satire of America's celebrity obsession but fizzled when the spoof was revealed.</p><p>“I think we were a little too subtle. People were not getting the joke," Rich later told the Chicago Tribune. "I don’t want to be dead.” </p><p>Rich was the little brother to a generation of TV viewers as the mop-top son of a newspaper columnist played by Dick Van Patten, who has to raise eight children alone after his wife in the show — and the actress who played her — died during filming of the first season. </p><p>Rich starred in the series “Code Red” from 1981-82 and voiced the character of Presto the Magician on “Dungeons &amp; Dragons” from 1983-85, according to the IMDB.com. He reprised his best-known role in two “Eight is Enough” TV movie reunions. </p><p>But the balance of his acting career was in single-episode appearances on some of the most popular TV shows of the time: “The Love Boat,” “The Six Million Dollar Man,” “Silver Spoons,” and “Baywatch.” His most recent credit listed on IMDB was playing Crocodile Dundee on “Reel Comedy” in 2003.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Eraldo Peres)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Supporters of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro who refuse to accept his election defeat stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and presidential palace Sunday, a week after the inauguration of his leftist rival, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.</p><p>Thousands of demonstrators bypassed security barricades, climbed on roofs, smashed windows and invaded all three buildings, which were believed to be largely vacant on the weekend. Some of the demonstrators called for a military intervention to either restore the far-right Bolsonaro to power or oust Lula from the presidency. </p><p>Hours went by before control of the buildings on Brasilia’s vast Three Powers Square was reestablished, with hundreds of the participants arrested.</p><p>In a news conference from Sao Paulo state, Lula accused Bolsonaro of encouraging the uprising by those he termed “fascist fanatics,” and he read a freshly signed decree for the federal government to take control of security in the federal district.</p><p>“There is no precedent for what they did and these people need to be punished,” Lula said.</p><p>TV channel Globo News showed protesters wearing the green and yellow colors of the national flag that also have come to symbolize the nation's conservative movement and were adopted by Bolsonaro's supporters.</p><div id="afs:Card:272901778982" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="0c03c098a5e2a09ac534412c30ae8355">Hub peek embed (JairBolsonaro) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>The former president has repeatedly sparred with Supreme Court justices, and the room where they convene was trashed by the rioters. They sprayed fire hoses inside the Congress building and ransacked offices at the presidential palace. Windows were broken in all of the buildings.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Bolsonaro, who <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-politics-brazil-miami-brasilia-bafec313b9fef5f7ab8717b524bd65de">flew to Florida ahead of Lula’s inauguration</a>, repudiated the president's accusation late Sunday. He wrote on Twitter that peaceful protest is part of democracy but vandalism and invasion of public buildings are “exceptions to the rule.” </p><p>Police fired tear gas in their efforts to recover the buildings, and were shown on television in the late afternoon marching protesters down a ramp from the presidential palace with their hands secured behind their backs. By early evening, with authorities' control of the buildings restored, Justice Minister Flavio Dino said in a news conference that roughly 200 people had been arrested and officers were firing more tear gas to drive away lingering protesters.</p><p>But with the damage already done, many in Brazil were questioning how the police had ignored abundant warnings, were unprepared or were somehow complicit.</p><p>Lula said at his news conference there was “incompetence or bad faith″ on the part of police, and that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-caribbean-brazil-brasilia-government-fa08598a3abecb1e0e1e621199c0861b">they had been likewise complacent when Bolsonaro supporters rioted in the capital weeks ago</a>. He promised those officers would be punished and expelled from the corps.</p><p>The incident recalled the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump. Political analysts have warned for months that a similar storming was a possibility in Brazil, given that Bolsonaro has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-caribbean-brazil-b7c872b541371ff2925fae793007af87">sown doubt about the reliability of the nation's electronic voting system</a><a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-caribbean-brazil-c03ec4f0e1d65fc81c02a2d90181cf48"></a> — without any evidence. The results were recognized as legitimate by politicians from across the spectrum, including some Bolsonaro allies, as well as dozens of foreign governments.</p><p>Unlike the 2021 attack in the U.S., few officials were likely to have been working in the Brazilian Congress and Supreme Court on a Sunday.</p><p>U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters that the riots in Brazil were “outrageous.” His national security adviser Jake Sullivan went a step further on Twitter and said the U.S. “condemns any effort to undermine democracy in Brazil.” </p><p>Biden later tweeted that he looked forward to continuing to work with Lula, calling the riots an “assault on democracy and on the peaceful transfer of power in Brazil.”</p><p>British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly tweeted: “The violent attempts to undermine democracy in Brazil are unjustifiable. President @LulaOficial and the government of Brazil have the full support of the UK.”</p><p>U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also said on Twitter that he condemned the assault on Brazil’s democratic institutions but he was confident “the will of the Brazilian people and the country’s institutions” would be respected. </p><p>Earlier videos on social media showed a limited presence of the capital's military police; one showed officers standing by as people flooded into Congress, with one using his phone to record images. The capital's security secretariat didn't respond to a request from The Associated Press for comment about the relative absence of the police.</p><p>“Brazilian authorities had two years to learn the lessons from the Capitol invasion and to prepare themselves for something similar in Brazil," said Maurício Santoro, political science professor at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. “Local security forces in Brasilia failed in a systematic way to prevent and to respond to extremist actions in the city. And the new federal authorities, such as the ministers of justice and of defense, were not able to act in a decisive way.”</p><p>Federal District Gov. Ibaneis Rocha confirmed on Twitter he had fired the capital city's head of public security, Anderson Torres. Local media reported that Torres is currently in the U.S.</p><p>The office of Lula’s attorney general asked the Supreme Court to order Torres’ imprisonment.</p><p>Bolsonaro supporters have been protesting Lula's electoral win since Oct. 30, blocking roads, setting vehicles on fire and gathering outside military buildings, urging the armed forces to intervene. The head of Brazil’s electoral authority rejected the request from Bolsonaro and his political party to nullify ballots cast on most electronic voting machines.</p><p>“Two years since Jan. 6, Trump’s legacy continues to poison our hemisphere,” U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez, who chairs the Senate’s foreign relations committee, tweeted, adding that he blamed Bolsonaro for inciting the acts. “Protecting democracy &amp; holding malign actors to account is essential.”</p>]]></description>

Hamlin remains hospitalized after suffering a catastrophic on-field collapse in the team's previous game against the Cincinnati Bengals. (AP Photo/Adrian Kraus)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — Damar Hamlin's old high school teammate clutched the ball he had just intercepted, jogged to the 30-yard line, <a href="https://twitter.com/NFLonCBS/status/1612184396399796224">gingerly placed the pigskin</a> at the top of the red-outlined “3," raised his hands over his head and formed them in the shape of a heart. </p><p>“I’m just glad I got a chance to go out there and make a play and honor him the way I did," said Hamlin's buddy, Colts safety Rodney Thomas II.</p><p>Thomas' gesture might have been the most poignant moment, but it was far from the only shout-out to the Bills safety on an NFL Sunday filled with love for a stricken player whose impact is being felt across the nation. </p><p>Hamlin's number — number “3” — was on display everywhere across the league, outlined on 30-yard lines on fields, worn on special patches on the Bills uniforms and featured on jackets and sweatshirts and even <a href="https://twitter.com/AP_NFL/status/1612143213128843264">on red hearts dangling from the tailgate tents</a> outside the Bills home stadium. </p><p>The highest volume of tribute poured in, naturally, from that parking lot in Orchard Park, New York, where Buffalo's 35-23 victory over New England was punctuated by a 96-yard kickoff return for a touchdown by Nyheim Hines on the game's opening play. </p><p>“OMFG!!!!!!!!!!!!!,” Hamlin tweeted after the quick score. </p><p>The safety, whose <a href="https://apnews.com/article/buffalo-bills-nfl-sports-health-damar-hamlin-28a376ee8c719bf344eac27ab689046c">recovery after his collapse on the field</a> Monday night in Cincinnati has overtaken every NFL story line, <a href="https://twitter.com/HamlinIsland/status/1612146641527799809">also shared a photo</a> of himself making a heart with his hands from his hospital bed shortly before kickoff with the text “GAMETIME!!! @BuffaloBills.”</p><p>Before that, in the lot outside of Highmark Stadium, Ryan Magnuson stood in front of a 4-x-10-foot canvas greeting card that he placed at the foot of the Bills stadium entrance for fans to sign. The message on the card: “If you get a chance to show some love today, do it. It won't cost you nothing” — a reprise of a <a href="https://twitter.com/hamlinisland/status/1442587824545484802">tweet Hamlin sent</a> back in 2021.</p><p>“It’s been very positive. I’ve seen Bills fans, I’ve seen Patriots fans and people wearing other NFL jerseys coming up. I think this is bigger than a team thing at this point,” Magnuson said. </p><p>Fifteen-hundred miles away, and three hours later in Denver, the Chargers and Broncos each walked to the numbers and linked arms near their respective sidelines before the game's first snap while the No. 3s on both teams — Russell Wilson and Derwin James Jr. — met at the 50-yard-line, shook hands and kneeled in prayer. </p><p>Philly running back Miles Sanders tweeted a picture of himself, wearing a “Love For Damar” sweatshirt, and flashing the number “3” while FaceTiming with Hamlin from his hospital.</p><p>Not all was warm and fuzzy. </p><p>In Cincinnati, Bengals running back Joe Mixon celebrated a touchdown by <a href="https://twitter.com/SportsCenter/status/1612156481910054912">mimicking a coin flip</a> — the likes of which could have happened, per a late NFL contingency plan — to decide home-field advantage in a potential playoff game between the Bengals and Ravens. </p><p>Cincinnati's 27-16 win over the Ravens on Sunday staved off that possibility. The Ravens will visit Cincy next week in the wild-card round. But saying all is back to normal in the NFL this week, or for the upcoming playoffs, still feels like a bit of a stretch. </p><p>The postseason is bound to be outfitted in “Love For Damar” sweatshirts and others embroidered with “Hamlin Strong,” the likes of which Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes wore during Saturday's win over the Raiders.

He was 82.</p><p>Banks, a professor emeritus at Princeton University, died Saturday in upstate New York, his editor, Dan Halpern, told The Associated Press. Banks was being treated for cancer, Halpern said.</p><p>Joyce Carol Oates, a former Princeton colleague who referred to Banks on Twitter as a great American writer and “beloved friend of so many," said he died peacefully in his home. </p><p>“I loved Russell &amp; loved his tremendous talent &amp; magnanimous heart,” Oates wrote. “'Cloudsplitter'” (was) his masterpiece, but all his work is exceptional.”</p><p>Born in Newton, Massachusetts, and raised in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, Banks was a self-styled heir to such 19th century writers as Nathaniel Hawthorne and Walt Whitman, aspiring to high art and a deep grasp of the country’s spirit. He was a plumber’s son who wrote often about working class families — whether those who died trying to break out, caught up in a “kind of madness” that the past can be erased, or those like himself who got away and survived and asked “Why me, Lord?”</p><div id="afs:Card:958899307023" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="bcec4ba2e2ea96f08341a95555241dcb">Hub peek embed (apf-entertainment) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Banks lived part of the year in Florida, and for a time had a home in Jamaica, but he was essentially a man of the North, with an old Puritan’s sense of consequences. Snow fell often in his fiction, from the upstate New York community torn by a bus crash in “The Sweet Hereafter” to the desperate, divorced New Hampshire policeman undone by his paranoid fantasies in “Affliction.” </p><p>In Banks’ critical breakthrough “Continental Drift,” published in 1985, oil burner repairman Bob Dubois flees from his native New Hampshire and goes into business with his wealthy brother in Florida, only to learn his brother’s life was as hollow as his own. </p><p>“His brother’s strut and brag were empty from the start, and in a deep, barely conscious way, Bob knew that all along and forgave him his strut and brag simply because he knew they were empty. But he had never believed it would come to this, to nothing,” Banks wrote. </p><p>“Cloudsplitter” was his most ambitious novel, a 750-page narrative on John Brown and his improbable quest to rid the country of slavery. The story long precedes Banks’ lifetime, but the inspiration was literally close to home. Banks lived near Brown’s burial ground in North Elba, New York, and he would pass by often enough that Brown “became a kind of ghostly presence,” the author told the AP in 1998.</p><p>“Cloudsplitter” reads like a prequel to Banks’ contemporary works, a summoning of Hawthorne and other early influences. As remembered by son Owen Brown, John Brown was a haunted man of the Old World whose resolve to free the slaves and punish the enslavers made his face burn like a revivalist preacher’s.</p><p>“I was a boy; I was frightened by my father’s face,” Banks’ narrator explains. “I remember father looking straight into our eyes, burning us with his gaze, as he told us to hear him now. He had determined that he would henceforth put his sins of pride and vanity behind him. And he would go out from here and wage war on slavery. The time has come, he declared, and he wished to join the time in full cry.”</p><p>Banks was a Pulitzer finalist for “Cloudsplitter” in 1999 and had been one 13 years earlier for “Continental Drift.” His other honors included the Anisfeld-Book Award for “Cloudsplitter” and membership in the American Academy of Arts and Letters.</p><p>Two of his books were adapted into acclaimed film releases in the late 1990s: “The Sweet Hereafter,” directed by Atom Egoyan and starring Ian Holm, and director Paul Schrader’s “Affliction,” which brought James Coburn an Academy Award for best supporting actor.</p><p>More recent works by Banks included the story collection “A Permanent Member of the Family” and the 2021 novel “Foregone,” in which an American filmmaker who moved to Canada during the Vietnam War looks back on his impulsive youth — a background Banks understood from the inside.</p><p>His books often told of absent and otherwise failing fathers and Banks’ own father, Earl Banks, was an alcoholic whom the author says beat him as a child and left him with a permanently damaged left eye. Russell was meant for other worlds, smart enough to have the nickname “Teacher” in high school and become the first of his family to attend college, receiving a full scholarship from Colgate University.</p><p>He was an idealist in search of ideals, among countless young people of the 1960s to adopt Jack Kerouac’s “On the Road” as a kind of Bible. He dropped out of Colgate and drove South with dreams of joining Fidel Castro’s revolutionary army in Cuba, a quest which ended in St. Petersburg, Florida.</p><p>He was married twice by his early 20s (and eventually had four children), endured more than a few bar fights, wrote poetry bad enough that he later wished he had burned it, worked for a time with his father as a plumber back in New Hampshire and resumed his education at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p><p>He was in his mid-30s, and nearing the end of his second marriage, when he published his first story collection, “Searching for Survivors,” and first novel, “Family Life.” By the start of the 1990s, when he turned 50, he was an established author and had settled into a lasting marriage with his fourth wife, the poet Chase Twichell.</p><p>“Over the years, I think that I’ve been able to make my anger coherent to myself, and that’s allowed me to become more lucid as a human being, as a writer, as — I hope — a husband, father, and friend,” he told Ploughshares for an interview that appeared in the magazine’s Winter 1993-94 issue. “It’s very hard to be a decent human being if you’re controlled by anger that you can’t understand. When you begin to acquire that understanding, you begin to become useful to other people.”</p>]]></description>

(Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>NEW YORK (AP) — The prize for best film of the year at the National Board of Review Awards went to “Top Gun: Maverick." Martin McDonagh's “The Banshees of Inisherin” took home the most trophies. But the night belonged to its best-director honoree, Steven Spielberg, and the parade of tributes paid to the 76-year-old filmmaker. </p><p>So effusive was the praise for Spielberg that Colin Farrell, there to accept the award for best actor for his performance in “The Banshees of Inisherin,” said the experience of first watching “E.T.” was the most euphoric of his life, ranking it even above the births of his two children. </p><p>“I'm glad this isn't televised,” said Farrell. </p><p>Despite the lack of a broadcast from Cipriani's 42 Street in midtown Manhattan, the National Board of Review Awards have long been a regular and starry stop in Hollywood's awards season. This year's ceremony, hosted Sunday for the seventh time by Willie Geist, came right in the thick of a battery of big dates on the Oscar calendar. The Golden Globes are Tuesday, the Screen Actor Guild nominations are Wednesday and voting for the Academy Awards starts Thursday. </p><p>That meant that the NBR Awards, <a href="https://nationalboardofreview.org/">put on by a long-running group of film enthusiasts</a>, was a chance to stoke buzz and polish acceptance speeches. The National Board of Review makes it easier, too, by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-movies-steven-spielberg-1aa6ae3e3a70679e9664fe55b722613e">announcing winners in advance</a> and pairing each with a lavish introduction from a collaborator or friend. Spielberg, who won best director for his movie-memoir “The Fabelmans,” was introduced by “West Side Story” star Ariana DeBose. </p><div id="afs:Card:958899307023" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="41dffefdcdd2b918eb6a4c370c4ad6e5">Hub peek embed (apf-entertainment) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>DeBose recalled being in a nail salon when “Steven (expletive) Spielberg” called to ask if she would join the cast.</p><p>“What I remember most about that moment, aside from the experience of realizing that blood was rushing to my head and to my feet simultaneously, was thinking: Wow, what a gentlemanly, respectful, generous call that that was to make," DeBose said. “To ask someone to join you in an adventure." </p><p>Gabriel LaBelle, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-canada-toronto-movies-9242c440957aa960e94dbd9f13faac12">who plays a fictionalized version of young Spielberg in “The Fabelmans”</a> and was honored for breakthrough performance along with <a href="https://apnews.com/article/danielle-deadwyler-2022-breakthrough-entertainer-till-movie-fd16ab87284b2c123c83087a57a6cb1e">Danielle Deadwyler of “Till,"</a> similarly described the life-changing nature of a call from Spielberg. </p><p>“I feel like I’m in debt, like I owe you, like I owe you my first born child or something,” LaBelle said, still in apparent disbelief at his turn of fate. "I don’t know how I’ll ever pay you back.” </p><p>When Spielberg took the stage, the crowd rose in a standing ovation. </p><p>"My whole career in all the films I've directed — my job, as I have seen it — is as the accompanist and the conductor to whoever or whatever should be the center of your attention," he said. “But when it came time for me to sit down with Tony Kushner to explore the possibilities of a story that became ‘The Fabelmans,’ I realized for the first time that I couldn't take cover behind a mothership or a T-Rex or a big mechanical shark that never worked.”</p><p>Much has been made about “The Fabelmans” being Spielberg's most personal film, a classification he didn't dispute. Though he noted that every movie, in any genre, can be personal to a director, Spielberg said making his latest “was like moving back in with my parents and my sisters.” </p><p>“You say you can’t go home again? Oh, no. That’s wrong. You can go home again,” he said. </p><p>Though Spielberg is renowned as a hit-maker, “The Fabelmans” has struggled to ignite at the box office with just $15.1 million worldwide, sapping some of its Oscar momentum. </p><p>Meanwhile, the awards hopes for a pair of theatrical successes — <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-tom-cruise-jerry-bruckheimer-california-74bbbb5552c75cb268ae8298e4fe1379">“Top Gun: Maverick”</a> and “Everything Everywhere All at Once” — have risen. “Top Gun” star Tom Cruise didn't attend Sunday, but producer Jerry Bruckheimer applauded him while accepting for best film. </p><p>“Simply put: He’s a force of nature,” Bruckheimer said. “A man with one goal: to entertain audiences.”</p><p>After being introduced by her “Crazy Rich Asians” co-star Awkwafina, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/michelle-yeoh-movie-92b9737f7ef574ea62dec51ba12516fd">“Everything Everywhere All at Once” star Michelle Yeoh</a> accepted the award for best actress. The Malaysian-born Yeoh noted she was the first Asian to win the award in nearly five decades, something that caused her to reflect on her journey from Hong Kong to Hollywood. </p><p>"One day Hollywood did come calling. It was an absolute dream come true. We all wanted to go to Hollywood — until I got there," Yeoh said. “Suddenly, I was a minority. I mean, how did that happen? There are more of me than you! I was typecast. I didn't see faces like mine on the screen. I met with people who didn't know where Korea and China and Japan were." </p><p>Best supporting actress went to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/janelle-monae-glass-onion-knives-out-movies-music-8f2eeed1fac2681d39dec254d83b7318">Janelle Monáe for the whodunit sequel “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.”</a> Her introduction came from Benoit Blanc, himself: Daniel Craig. “Are you kidding me?” Monáe exclaimed. “You guys got (expletive) James Bond?”</p><p>“When Janelle floats, when she glides into a room, the chemicals in the air change,” Craig said of his “Glass Onion” co-star. “When I had the privilege of working with her, every day she lifted me up." </p><p>Brendan Gleeson, who stars opposite Farrell in “The Banshees of Inisherin," wasn't there to accept his award for best supporting actor, though Farrell read a letter from him. Gleeson remarked on the success of Martin McDonagh's movie: "Happy days for a sad film."</p><p>McDonagh was also honored with the award for best original screenplay. Oscar Isaac, who stars in the playwright's next film, introduced McDonagh by recalling his first meeting with him at a London pub, an encounter that ended in the two sharing mushrooms. Once he reached the stage, McDonagh thanked Isaac “for revealing only one of my drug preferences.” </p><p>McDonagh then made one of the night's most pointed remarks, applauding his film's distributor, Searchlight Pictures, for giving him no notes on the screenplay: “Which is probably why I'm up here tonight.” </p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP</p>]]></description>

In posts sent from her Twitter account in 2015 she called on Americans to join the group and carry out attacks in the U.S., suggesting drive-by shootings or vehicle rammings targeting gatherings for national holidays.</p><div class="social-embed" id="se0:e86b8fa0-7820-11ed-966c-35481ab1f878"><div class="display-block"><style>@media only screen and (max-width: 415px){.htmlEmbedContent {width: 90%;margin: 0 auto;}}@media only screen and (min-width: 415px){.htmlEmbedContent {width: 70%;}}.youtube-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .youtube-container iframe { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class="youtube-container"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VAQ4tDTh46A" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></div></div><p class="social-caption"> </p></div><p>In her interview with TNM, Muthana now says her phone was taken from her and that the tweets were sent by IS supporters.</p><p>Muthana was born in New Jersey to Yemeni immigrants and once had a U.S. passport. She was raised in a conservative Muslim household in Hoover, Alabama, just outside Birmingham. In 2014, she told her family she was going on a school trip but flew to Turkey and crossed into Syria instead, funding the travel with tuition checks that she had secretly cashed.</p><p>The Obama administration cancelled her citizenship in 2016, saying her father was an accredited Yemeni diplomat at the time she was born — a rare revocation of birthright citizenship. Her lawyers have disputed that move, arguing that the father's diplomatic accreditation ended before she was born.</p><p>The Trump administration maintained that she was not a citizen and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/f1e0816ed7a34d489818e487a4904430">barred her from returning</a>, even as it pressed European allies to repatriate their own detained nationals to reduce pressure on the detention camps.</p><p>U.S. courts have sided with the government on the question of Muthana's citizenship, and last January the Supreme Court <a href="https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-alabama-united-states-birmingham-islamic-state-group-5195dd68a8b6753bac474265c5d108f7">declined to consider her lawsuit seeking re-entry</a>.</p><p>That has left her and her son languishing in a detention camp in northern Syria housing thousands of widows of Islamic State fighters and their children.</p><p>Some 65,600 suspected Islamic State members and their families — both Syrians and foreign citizens — are held in camps and prisons in northeastern Syria run by U.S.-allied Kurdish groups, according to a Human Rights Watch report <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/12/15/syria-repatriations-lag-foreigners-alleged-isis-ties">released last month</a>. </p><p>Women accused of affiliation with IS and their minor children are largely housed in the al-Hol and Roj camps, under what the rights group described as “life threatening conditions.” The camp inmates include more than 37,400 foreigners, among them Europeans and North Americans. </p><p>Human Rights Watch and other monitors have cited dire living conditions in the camps, including inadequate food, water and medical care, as well as the physical and sexual abuse of inmates by guards and fellow detainees.</p><p>Kurdish-led authorities and activists have blamed IS sleeper cells for surging violence within the facilities, including the beheading of two Egyptian girls, aged 11 and 13, in al-Hol camp in November. Turkish airstrikes targeting the Kurdish groups launched that month also hit close to al-Hol. Camp officials alleged that the Turkish strikes were targeting security forces guarding the camp.</p><p>“None of the foreigners have been brought before a judicial authority … to determine the necessity and legality of their detention, making their captivity arbitrary and unlawful,” Human Rights Watch wrote. “Detention based solely on family ties amounts to collective punishment, a war crime.”</p><p>Calls to repatriate the detainees were largely ignored in the immediate aftermath of IS' bloody reign, which was marked by massacres, beheadings and other atrocities, many of which were broadcast to the world in graphic films circulated on social media.</p><p>But with the passage of time, the pace of repatriations has started to pick up. Human Rights Watch said some 3,100 foreigners — mostly women and children — have been sent home over the past year. Most were Iraqis, who comprise the majority of detainees, but citizens were also repatriated to Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Russia and the United Kingdom. </p><p>The U.S. has repatriated a total of 39 American nationals. It's unclear how many other Americans remain in the camps.</p><p>These days, Muthana portrays herself as a victim of the Islamic State.</p><p>Speaking with TNM, she describes how, after arriving in Syria in 2014, she was detained in a guest house reserved for unmarried women and children. “I’ve never seen that kind of filthiness in my life, like there was 100 women and twice as much kids, running around, too much noise, filthy beds," she said. </p><p>The only way to escape was to marry a fighter. She eventually married and remarried three times. Her first two husbands, including the father of her son, were killed in battle. She reportedly divorced her third husband.</p><p>The extremist group, which is also known as ISIS, no longer controls any territory in Syria or Iraq but continues to carry out sporadic attacks and has supporters in the camps themselves. Muthana says she still has to be careful about what she says because of fear of reprisal.</p><p>“Even here, right now, I can’t fully say everything I want to say. But once I do leave, I will. I will be an advocate against this,” she said. “I wish I can help the victims of ISIS in the West understand that someone like me is not part of it, that I as well am a victim of ISIS.”</p><p>Hassan Shibly, an attorney who has assisted Muthana’s family, said it is “absolutely clear that she was brainwashed and taken advantage of.” </p><p>He said her family wishes she could come back, pay her debt to society and then help others from "falling into the dark path that she was led down."</p><p>“She was absolutely misguided, and no one is denying that. But again, she was a teenager who was the victim of a very sophisticated recruitment operation that focuses on taking advantage of the young, the vulnerable, the disenfranchised,” he said. </p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[CES 2023: Smelling, touching take center stage in metaverse]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/c078bf1d0a954a69a4a64b5320b77b46/3000.jpeg" alt="Attendees wear VR headsets while previewing the Caliverse Hyper-Realistic Metaverse experience at the Lotte booth during the CES tech show Friday, Jan. 6, 2023, in Las Vegas.

(AP Photo/John Locher)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>LAS VEGAS (AP) — Is the metaverse closer than we think?</p><p>It depends on who you ask at CES, where companies are showing off innovations that could <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-science-business-las-vegas-consumer-electronics-show-ddb35495abeb87e054a83ab0bed1ae7b">immerse us deeper into virtual reality</a>, otherwise known as VR. </p><p>The metaverse — essentially a buzzword for three-dimensional virtual communities where people can meet, work and play — was a key theme during the four-day tech gathering in Las Vegas that ends Sunday. </p><p>Taiwanese tech giant HTC unveiled a high-end VR headset that aims to compete with market leader Meta, and a slew of other companies and startups touted augmented reality glasses and sensory technologies that can help users feel — and even smell — in a virtual environment. </p><p>Among them, Vermont-based OVR Technology showcased a headset containing a cartridge with eight primary aromas that can be combined to create different scents. It's scheduled to be released later this year.</p><p>An earlier, business-focused version used primarily for marketing fragrances and beauty products is integrated into VR goggles and allows users to smell anything from a romantic bed of roses to a marshmallow roasting over a fire at a campsite. </p><p>The company says it aims to help consumers relax and is marketing the product, which comes with an app, as a sort of digital spa mixed with Instagram.</p><div id="afs:Card:710305756722" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="c9de16360932e6a1fa7c4dcc8f86832c">Hub peek embed (apf-technology) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“We are entering an era in which extended reality will drive commerce, entertainment, education, social connection, and wellbeing,” the company’s CEO and co-founder Aaron Wisniewski said in a statement. “The quality of these experiences will be measured by how immersive and emotionally engaging they are. Scent imbues them with an unmatched power.”</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>But more robust and immersive uses of scent — and its close cousin, taste — are still further away on the innovation spectrum. Experts say even VR technologies that are more accessible are in the early days of their development and too expensive for many consumers to purchase. </p><p>The numbers show there's waning interest. According to the research firm NPD Group, sales of VR headsets, which found popular use in gaming, declined by 2% last year, a sour note for companies betting big on more adoption.</p><p>Still, big companies like Microsoft and Meta are investing billions. And many others are joining the race to grab some market share in supporting technologies, including wearables that replicate touch. </p><p>Customers, though, aren't always impressed by what they find. Ozan Ozaskinli, a tech consultant who traveled more than 29 hours from Istanbul to attend CES, suited up with yellow gloves and a black vest to test out a so-called haptics product, which relays sensations through buzzes and vibrations and stimulates our sense of touch. </p><p>Ozaskinli was attempting to punch in a code on a keypad that allowed him to pull a lever and unlock a box containing a shiny gemstone. But the experience was mostly a letdown. </p><p>“I think that’s far from reality right now,” Ozaskinli said. “But if I was considering it to replace Zoom meetings, why not? At least you can feel something.”</p><p>Proponents say widespread adoption of virtual reality will ultimately benefit different parts of society by essentially unlocking the ability to be with anyone, anywhere at any time. Though it's too early to know what these technologies can do once they fully mature, companies looking to achieve the most immersive experiences for users are welcoming them with open arms. </p><p>Aurora Townsend, the chief marketing officer at Flare, a company slated to launch a VR dating app called Planet Theta next month, said her team is building its app to incorporate more sensations like touch once the technology becomes more widely available on the consumer market. </p><p>“Being able to feel the ground when you’re walking with your partner, or holding their hands while you’re doing that… subtle ways we engage people will change once haptic technology is fully immersive in VR,” Townsend said. </p><p>Still, it's unlikely that many of these products will become widely used in the next few years, even in gaming, said Matthew Ball, a metaverse expert. Instead, he said the pioneers of adoption are likely to be fields that have higher budgets and more precise needs, such as bomb units using haptics and virtual reality to help with their work and others in the medical field.</p><p>In 2021, Johns Hopkins neurosurgeons said they used augmented reality to perform spinal fusion surgery and remove a cancerous tumor from a patient’s spine. </p><p>And optical technology from Lumus, an Israeli company that makes AR glasses, is already being used by underwater welders, fighter pilots and surgeons who want to monitor a patient’s vital signs or MRI scans during a procedure without having to look up at several screens, said David Goldman, vice president of marketing for the company.</p><p>Meanwhile, Xander, a Boston-based startup which makes smart glasses that display real-time captions of in-person conversations for people with hearing loss, will launch a pilot program with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs next month to test out some of its technology, said Alex Westner, the company’s co-founder and CEO. He said the agency will allow veterans who have appointments for hearing loss or other audio issues to try out the glasses in some of their clinics. And if it goes well, the agency would likely become a customer, Westner said.</p><p>Elsewhere, big companies from Walmart to Nike have been launching different initiatives in virtual reality. But it's unclear how much they can benefit during the early stages of the technology. The consulting firm McKinsey says the metaverse could generate up to $5 trillion by 2030. But outside of gaming, much of today’s VR use remains somewhat of a marginal amusement, said Michael Kleeman, a tech strategist and visiting scholar at the University of California San Diego. </p><p>“When people are promoting this, what they have to answer is — where’s the value in this? Where’s the profit? Not what’s fun, what’s cute and what’s interesting.”</p><p>___</p><p>For more coverage of CES, visit: <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/technology">https://apnews.com/hub/technology</a></p>]]></description>

Ukrainian officials denied there were any casualties. </p><p>The Russian Defense Ministry said its missiles hit two temporary bases housing 1,300 Ukrainian troops in Kramatorsk, in the eastern Donetsk region, killing 600 of them. Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said the strikes were retaliation for Ukraine’s attack in Makiivka, in which at least 89 Russian soldiers died.</p><p>Serhii Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for Ukraine's forces in the east, told The Associated Press that Russian strikes on Kramatorsk damaged only civilian infrastructure, adding: “The armed forces of Ukraine weren’t affected.”</p><p>The Donetsk regional administration said seven Russian missiles hit Kramatorsk and two more hit Kostyantynivka, without causing any casualties. It said an educational institution, an industrial facility and garages were damaged in Kramatorsk, and an industrial zone was hit in Kostyantynivka.</p><p>Kramatorsk Mayor Oleksandr Honcharenko said two school buildings and eight apartment houses were hit overnight. Photos he posted showed no indication that it had been an attack on the scale claimed by the Russians or that anyone had been in the buildings when they were struck.</p><div id="afs:Card:521103274690" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="46a8599f1fa971b8c773af2745326540">Hub peek embed (Russia-Ukraine) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“The world saw again these days that Russia lies even when it draws attention to the situation at the front with its own statements,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. </p><p>“Russian shelling of Kherson with incendiary ammunition right after Christmas. The strikes on Kramatorsk and other cities of the Donbas — aimed right at civilian sites and right when Moscow was reporting the supposed ‘silence’ of its army.” </p><p>Russia had declared a 36-hour cease-fire timed to coincide with <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-moscow-religion-orthodox-church-9bea8791e5eda36a0b01cb3b6da86bd5">Orthodox Christmas celebrations</a> on Saturday. Ukraine denounced the pause as a ploy. </p><p>Russia said the attack on Kramatorsk was in retaliation for the Ukrainian rockets that destroyed a facility in Makiivka, also in the eastern Donetsk region, where Russian soldiers were gathered in the early hours of Jan. 1. It was one of the deadliest attacks on the Kremlin’s forces since <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine">the war</a> began more than 10 months ago.</p><p>Also on Sunday, the Ukrainian military claimed to have hit a residential hall of a medical university in Rubizhne, a town in the Russian-occupied eastern Luhansk region, killing 14 Russian soldiers housed there. The number of wounded was unknown, it said.</p><p>Elsewhere in the east, Donetsk Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said one person was killed in strikes on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kyiv-politics-russia-ukraine-war-1389e0bc90800ce033d344b0bc69bff9">Bakhmut</a>, and eight others were wounded. The battles for Bakhmut and the nearby town of Soledar remained among the bloodiest on the front, Zelenskyy said.</p><p>In the northeastern Kharkiv region, the town of Merefa was hit during the night, killing one person, and two other settlements in the region were shelled, Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said.</p><p>Russia and Ukraine exchanged prisoners Sunday, swapping 50 on each side, according to Konashenkov, the spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, and Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian president's office.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP’s coverage of the war at <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine">https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine</a></p>]]></description>

(Jane Barlow/PA via AP)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>LONDON (AP) — Prince Harry defended his decision to publish <a href="https://apnews.com/article/prince-harry-book-details-ce879703cbc92372e4736313c6cab941">a memoir</a> that lays bare rifts inside Britain’s royal family, saying it's an attempt to “own my story” after 38 years of “spin and distortion” by others.</p><p>Harry spoke to Britain’s ITV and CBS's “60 Minutes” to promote his book, “Spare,” which has generated incendiary headlines with its details of private emotional turmoil and bitter family resentments. </p><p>In interviews broadcast Sunday, Harry accused members of the royal family of getting "into bed with the devil” to gain favorable tabloid coverage, claimed his stepmother Camilla, the queen consort, had leaked private conversations to the media and said his family was “complicit” in his wife Meghan's “pain and suffering.”</p><p>Harry said Camilla had to rehabilitate her image with the British people after her longtime affair with his father and that he was one of the victims of her efforts for better coverage in the tabloids. </p><p>“That made her dangerous because of the connections that she was forging within the British press,” he told CBS. “There was open willingness on both sides to trade information. And with a family built on hierarchy, and with her, on the way to being queen consort, there was gonna be people or bodies left in the street.”</p><p>He repeated his claim on ITV that there was “concern” in the royal family about his unborn child’s skin color after he married biracial American actress Meghan Markle, and said the British monarchy should address its attitudes to race.</p><div id="afs:Card:061068668642" content-id="7082bf624e4b43826d0cc39ce69f961f" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (PrinceHarry) - Compressed layout </div><p>Harry and Meghan first mentioned the incident during an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021. They have not identified the family member who expressed concern.</p><p>Harry said the episode was an example of unconscious bias rather than racism, adding that the royal family needed to “learn and grow” in order to be “part of the solution rather than part of the problem.”</p><p>“Otherwise unconscious bias then moves into the category of racism,” Harry said. He said that “especially when you are the monarchy – you have a responsibility, and quite rightly people hold you to a higher standard than others.”</p><p>He said <a href="https://apnews.com/064aef43a1884bbfe4194ebdf88aed85">a recent incident</a> in which a former lady-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth II asked a Black British woman where she was “really” from was “a very good example of the environment within the institution.”</p><p>“Spare” explores Harry’s grief at the death of his mother in 1997, and his long-simmering resentment at the role of royal “spare,” overshadowed by the “heir” — older brother Prince William. He recounts arguments and a physical altercation with William, reveals how he lost his virginity (in a field) and describes using cocaine and cannabis.</p><p>He also says he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/prince-harry-afghanistan-service-claims-1c497d35a8211dc0366429856a539e2a">killed 25 Taliban fighters</a> while serving as an Apache helicopter pilot in Afghanistan — a claim criticized by both the Taliban and British military veterans.</p><p>Harry told ITV that he cried only once after his mother’s death — at her burial. He said he feels guilt about not showing emotion when he and William greeted crowds of mourners outside Kensington Palace, Diana’s London home.</p><p>In the book Harry blames his family’s stiff-upper-lip ethos, saying he had “learned too well … the family maxim that crying is not an option.” The Associated Press purchased a Spanish-language copy of the book in advance of its publication around the world on Tuesday.</p><p>“There were 50,000 bouquets of flowers to our mother and there we were shaking people’s hands, smiling,” Harry told ITV journalist Tom Bradby. “I’ve seen the videos, right, I looked back over it all. And the wet hands that we were shaking, we couldn’t understand why their hands were wet, but it was all the tears that they were wiping away.</p><p>“Everyone thought and felt like they knew our mum, and the two closest people to her, the two most loved people by her, were unable to show any emotion in that moment.”</p><p>Harry told “60 Minutes” that it took him over a decade to accept that his mother was dead. He and his brother often discussed the notion that she had gone into hiding and would reappear later. </p><p>“I had huge amounts of hope," he said.</p><p>It was only after reading the police report of his mother's death, seeing photos from the scene and later — at the age of 23 — following the same route into the Paris tunnel where his mother died when her driver crashed while evading paparazzi that her death became a reality, he said. </p><p>“Spare” is the latest in a string of public pronouncements by Harry and Meghan since they <a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-canada-entertainment-celebrities-queen-elizabeth-ii-8cb152f4cdd09fc7d312d86c7e704b87">quit royal life</a> and moved to California in 2020, citing what they saw as the media’s racist treatment of Meghan and a lack of support from the palace. It follows the Winfrey interview and a six-part <a href="https://apnews.com/article/king-charles-iii-entertainment-london-meghan-markle-prince-harry-7d92f6e8db06b2694a386eac01cfd38c">Netflix documentary</a> released last month.</p><p>In the ghostwritten memoir, Harry, 38, describes the couple’s acrimonious split from the royal family in early 2020, after their request for a part-time royal role was rejected. </p><p>Harry contrasts the withdrawal of the couple’s taxpayer-funded security with the case of his uncle, Prince Andrew, who was removed as a working royal over his friendship with the U.S. sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>Last year, Andrew <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-arts-and-entertainment-lawsuits-royalty-prince-andrew-4abc060592c70dd26e3ec9ce99395e6c">settled a lawsuit</a> from a woman who accused him of sexually abusing her while she traveled with financier Epstein when she was 17. Andrew paid an undisclosed sum as part of the settlement, but didn’t admit wrongdoing.</p><p>Harry alleges that no one considered removing Andrew’s security despite the “shameful scandal.”</p><p>The TV interviews are just two of several given by Harry that are set to heap more pressure on the royal family. He is also appearing on “Good Morning America” and “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”</p><p>Royal officials haven’t commented on any of the allegations, though allies have pushed back on the claims, largely anonymously.</p><p>Veteran British journalist Jonathan Dimbleby, a biographer and friend of King Charles III, said Saturday that Harry’s revelations were the type “that you’d expect … from a sort of B-list celebrity,” and that the king would be pained and frustrated by them.</p><p>In the “60 Minutes” interview, Harry denied that his description of his brother’s “alarming baldness” and fading resemblance to their mother as he aged was harsh and said his book was not intended to hurt his family.</p><p>While he said that he hadn’t spoken with his father or brother in a while, he hopes to find peace with them. Harry told ITV that he wants reconciliation with the royal family, but “the ball is in their court.”</p><p>“They’ve shown absolutely no willingness to reconcile,” he said.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Brian Melley contributed to this story from Los Angeles.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>EL PASO, Texas (AP) — President Joe Biden walked a muddy stretch of the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-mexico-government-canada-united-states-33afbe7f2b31101fcfe4ead41d6cdc3a">U.S.-Mexico border</a> and inspected a busy port of entry Sunday on his first trip to the region after two years in office, a visit shadowed by the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-mexico-immigration-covid-93d735b9b55c15121c8fc7763fba7e78">fraught politics of immigration</a> as Republicans blame him for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-mexico-us-customs-and-border-protection-cuba-immigration-8fbba5bde9afca3f404eaa96bcfd136a">record numbers of migrants</a> crossing into the country.</p><p>At his first stop, the president observed as border officers in <a href="https://www.elpasotexas.gov/Migrant-Crisis">El Paso</a> demonstrated how they search vehicles for <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/opioids">drugs</a>, money and other contraband. Next, he traveled to a dusty street with abandoned buildings and walked along a metal border fence that separated the U.S. city from Ciudad Juarez.</p><p>His last stop was the El Paso County Migrant Services Center — but there were no migrants in sight. As he learned about the services offered there, he asked an aid worker, “If I could wave the wand, what should I do?” The answer was not audible.</p><p>Biden’s nearly four-hour visit to El Paso was highly controlled. He encountered no migrants except when his motorcade drove alongside the border and about a dozen were visible on the Ciudad Juárez side. His visit did not include time at a Border Patrol station, where migrants who cross illegally are arrested and held before their release. He delivered no public remarks.</p><p>The visit seemed designed to showcase a smooth operation to process legal migrants, weed out smuggled contraband and humanely treat those who have entered illegally, creating a counter-narrative to Republicans’ claims of a crisis situation equivalent to an open border.</p><p>But his visit was likely do little to quell critics from both sides, including immigrant advocates who accuse him of establishing cruel policies not unlike those of his hard-line predecessor, Donald Trump.</p><p>In a sign of the deep tensions over immigration, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, handed Biden a letter as soon as he touched down in the state that said the “chaos” at the border was a “direct result” of the president’s failure to enforce federal laws. Biden later took the letter out of his jacket pocket during his tour, telling reporters, “I haven’t read it yet.”</p><p>House Speaker Kevin McCarthy dismissed Biden's visit as a “photo op,” saying on Twitter that the Republican majority would hold the administration “accountable for creating the most dangerous border crisis in American history.”</p><p>El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego welcomed Biden’s visit, but said a current lull in arrivals prevented the president from seeing how large the group of newcomers has been.</p><p>“He didn’t get to see the real difficulties,” said Samaniego, who was in the local delegation that greeted Biden. “It was good that he was here. It’s a first step. But we still need to do more and have more time with him.”</p><div id="afs:Card:727527520251" content-id="2e30ea26bbc55c7af509a6e60ad3d33c" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (Immigration) - Compressed layout </div><p>Elsewhere in El Paso where Biden did not visit, hundreds of migrants were gathered Sunday outside the Sacred Heart Catholic Church, where they have been sleeping outdoors and receiving three meals a day from faith groups and other humanitarian organizations.</p><p>The migrants included several pregnant women, including Karla Sainz, 26, eight months along. She was traveling in a small group that included her 2-year-old son, Joshua. Sainz left her three other children back home in Venezuela with her mother.</p><p>“I would ask President Biden to help me with a permission or something so we can work and continue,” she said.</p><p>Juan Tovar, 32, one of several people in her group, suggested he also had political reasons for leaving his home country.</p><p>“Socialism is the worst,” he said. “In Venezuela, they kill us, they torture us, we can’t talk bad about the government. We are worse off than in Cuba.”</p><p>Noengris Garcia, also eight months pregnant, was traveling with her husband, teen son and the small family dog from the tiny state of Portuguesa, Venezuela, where she operated a food stall.</p><p>“We don’t want to be given money or a house,” said Garcia, 39. “We just want to work.”</p><p>Asked what he’s learned by seeing the border firsthand and speaking with the officers who work along it, Biden said: “They need a lot of resources. We’re going to get it for them.”</p><p>El Paso is currently the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-el-paso-united-states-government-cuba-82701453fb018778c04255c1e2b10564">biggest corridor for illegal crossings</a>, in large part due to Nicaraguans fleeing repression, crime and poverty in their country. They are among migrants from four countries who are now subject to quick expulsion under <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-mexico-immigration-af0643a4fb8f45388fe247e44c9b2c5e">new rules enacted by the Biden administration</a> in the past week that drew strong criticism from immigration advocates.</p><p>Biden's recent policy announcements on border security and his visit to the border were aimed in part at blunting the impact of upcoming investigations into immigration promised by House Republicans. But any enduring solution will require action by the sharply divided Congress, where multiple efforts to enact sweeping changes have failed in recent years.</p><p>From Texas, Biden traveled south to Mexico City, where <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-mexico-government-us-national-security-council-united-states-599d640834d079503c5dd568c312c19f">he and the leaders of Mexico and Canada will gather</a> on Monday and Tuesday for a North American leaders summit. Immigration is among the items on the agenda. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador met Biden at the airport Sunday night and joined him in the presidential limousine for the ride to Biden's hotel. </p><p>The numbers of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border has risen dramatically during Biden’s first two years in office. There were more than 2.38 million stops during the year that ended Sept. 30, the first time the number topped 2 million. The administration has struggled to clamp down on crossings, reluctant to take measures that would resemble those of Trump's administration.</p><p>The policy changes announced this past week are Biden's biggest move yet to contain illegal border crossings and will turn away tens of thousands of migrants arriving at the border. At the same time, 30,000 migrants per month from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela will get the chance to come to the U.S. legally as long as they travel by plane, get a sponsor and pass background checks. </p><p>The U.S. will also turn away migrants who do not seek asylum first in a country they traveled through en route to the U.S. Migrants are being asked to complete a form on a phone app so that they they can go to a port of entry at a pre-scheduled date and time.</p><p>Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters aboard Air Force One that the administration is trying to “incentivize a safe and orderly way and cut out the smuggling organizations,” saying the policies are “not a ban at all" but an attempt to protect migrants from the trauma that smuggling can create.</p><p>The changes were welcomed by some, particularly leaders in cities where migrants have been massing. But Biden was excoriated by immigrant advocate groups, which accused him of taking measures modeled after those of the former president. Administration officials disputed that characterization.</p><p>For all of his international travel over his 50 years in public service, Biden has not spent much time at the U.S.-Mexico border. </p><p>The only visit that the White House could point to was Biden's drive by the border while he was campaigning for president in 2008. He sent <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-immigration-2c5747617f9c60b2b3be4ce99895a0b8">Vice President Kamala Harris to El Paso in 2021</a>, but she was criticized for largely bypassing the action, because El Paso wasn't the center of crossings that it is now. </p><p>Trump, who made hardening immigration a signature issue, traveled to the border several times. </p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Andres Leighton in El Paso, Texas; Anita Snow in Phoenix; Morgan Lee in Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Josh Boak in Washington contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Kathleen Ronayne)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — California was hit with more turbulent weather Sunday as thunderstorms, snow and damaging winds swept into the northern part the state, preceding another series of incoming storms and raising the potential for road flooding, rising rivers and mudslides on soils already saturated after days of rain.</p><p>The National Weather Service <a href="https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=pmdspd">warned</a> of a “relentless parade of atmospheric rivers" — storms that are long plumes of moisture stretching out into the Pacific capable of dropping staggering amounts of rain and snow.</p><p>In the state capital, more than 60,000 customers were still without electricity Sunday evening — down from more than 350,000 — after gusts of 60 mph (97 kph) knocked trees into power lines, according to the <a href="https://www.smud.org/en/Customer-Support/Outage-Status">Sacramento Municipal Utility District</a>. </p><p>Joey Kleemann was listening to the winds howling shortly after midnight, wondering whether she should move her car, when she heard a “gigantic, thumping, crashing sound” as a massive tree fell onto the Sacramento home where she's lived for 25 years. </p><p>The gusts were strong enough to rip the tree from its roots, pulling the concrete sidewalk up with it. </p><p>Cracks in Kleemann's roof meant rain streamed into her dining area throughout the night. She planned to place a tarp over the damaged area in anticipation of another deluge.</p><p>“I just had a feeling with the winds. They were scary winds,” she said. “Mostly I focused on: It could be so much worse.”</p><p>Gov. Gavin Newsom said 12 people lost their lives as a result of violent weather during the past 10 days, and he warned that this week's storms could be even more dangerous.

(Ronen Zvulun/Pool Photo via AP)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel on Sunday revoked the Palestinian foreign minister's VIP travel permit, part of a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-israel-palestinian-territories-government-middle-east-f795eb80d0c96c185cd2a3c6ea81119f">series of punitive steps</a> against the Palestinians that Israel's new hard-line government announced days ago.</p><p>Riad Malki said in a statement that he was returning from the Brazilian president's inauguration when he was informed that Israel rescinded his VIP travel permit, which allows top Palestinian officials to travel more easily in and out of the occupied West Bank than ordinary Palestinians. It was not clear whether the permits of other officials had been revoked as well.</p><p>Israel's government on Friday approved the steps to penalize the Palestinians in retaliation for them pushing the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-israel-government-west-bank-united-nations-dff4f816f0962eeeb16527caf763a695">U.N.’s highest judicial body</a> to give its opinion on the Israeli occupation. Rulings by the International Court of Justice are not binding, but they can be influential on world opinion.</p><p>The decision highlights the tough line the current government is already taking toward the Palestinians just days into its tenure. It comes at a time of spiking violence in the occupied West Bank and as peace talks are a distant memory.</p><p>In east Jerusalem, a flashpoint of Israeli-Palestinian tensions, Israeli police said they broke up a meeting by Palestinian parents about their children’s education, claiming it was unlawfully funded by the Palestinian Authority. Police said the operation came at the behest of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-religion-jerusalem-israel-benjamin-netanyahu-189ef3fc8c82d7163c1339e64bb1e40f">National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir</a>, an ultranationalist with a long record of anti-Arab rhetoric and stunts who now oversees the police.</p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="91ba538476380a16aad4e2cbdae2e235">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The Palestinians condemned the revoking of Malki's permit, saying Israel should be the one being “punished for its violations against international law.”</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a meeting of his Cabinet on Sunday the measures against the Palestinians were aimed at what he called “an extreme anti-Israel” step at the U.N. Israel’s Defense Ministry confirmed that Malki's permit had been revoked. Malki's office said he was still permitted to travel like ordinary Palestinians, but had lost the VIP privileges that allow him to bypass lines and move quickly through Israeli checkpoints or through the West Bank's crossing into Jordan.</p><p>On Friday, the government's Security Cabinet decided Israel would withhold $39 million from the Palestinian Authority and transfer the funds instead to a compensation program for the families of Israeli victims of Palestinian militant attacks.</p><p>It also said Israel would further deduct revenue it typically transfers to the cash-strapped PA — a sum equal to the amount the authority paid last year to families of Palestinian prisoners and those killed in the conflict, including militants implicated in attacks against Israelis. The Palestinian leadership describes the payments as necessary social welfare, while Israel says the so-called Martyrs’ Fund incentivizes violence. Israel’s withheld funds threaten to exacerbate the PA’s fiscal woes.</p><p>The Security Cabinet also targeted Palestinian officials directly, saying it would deny benefits to “VIPs who are leading the political and legal war against Israel.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Israel's new defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said he was stripping three senior Palestinian officials of VIP privileges allowing them to enter Israel. The move came after they visited an Arab citizen of Israel who was released from prison last week after serving 40 years for the murder of an Israeli soldier.</p><p>The police operation Saturday came days after Ben-Gvir took office. Police alleged the parents' meeting was funded by the Palestinian Authority and attended by PA activists, which it said was in violation of Israeli law. Police said they prevented the meeting from taking place and that they were operating under an order by Ben-Gvir to shut it down. Police declined to provide evidence backing up their claim and a spokesman for Ben-Gvir referred questions to the police.</p><p>Ziad Shamali, head of the Students' Parents' Committees Union in Jerusalem, which was holding the meeting, denied there was any PA involvement, saying it was being held to discuss a shortage of teachers in east Jerusalem schools. He said he viewed the claim of PA ties as “a political pretext to ban” the meeting.</p><p>The Palestinian Authority was created to administer Gaza and parts of the occupied West Bank. Israel opposes any official business being carried out by the PA in east Jerusalem, and police have in the past broken up events they alleged were linked to the PA.</p><p>Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed it, a move unrecognized by most of the international community. Israel considers the city its undivided, eternal capital. The Palestinians seek the city's eastern sector as the capital of their hoped-for state.</p><p>About a third of the city's population is Palestinian and they have long faced neglect and discrimination at the hands of Israeli authorities, including in education, housing and public services.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Tia Goldenberg in Tel Aviv contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

Then came tears during the playing of the American anthem when her thoughts turned to her father, Jeff, who died three years ago.</p><p>“My dad used to be there and taking pictures. Most races these days I’ll think about him and I’m able to kind of refocus,” Shiffrin said. “But when I’m singing the national anthem (it's different). It was just before I ever won my first World Cup, he said, ‘You better memorize the words of the national anthem, because if you ever win, you better sing it.’ And so I always think about him when I’m up there.”</p><p>There were also an emotional embrace between Shiffrin and her mother, Eileen, who has coached the skier since childhood and been with her daughter every step of the way since her first World Cup win slightly more than a decade ago.</p><p>Shiffrin led from start to finish to win a giant slalom by a large margin and can now break Vonn’s mark in a night slalom scheduled for Flachau, Austria, on Tuesday.</p><div id="afs:Card:541131129162" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="aa16eabb472c4d020dce712ba18530f3">Hub peek embed (Skiing) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“I was so nervous this run. I have a rash on my face I was so nervous,” Shiffrin said. “I don’t know why, maybe a little bit was because of 82. I just really wanted to ski well, and I did."</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Where other skiers struggled on a dark, bumpy and unusually steep course, Shiffrin was able to ski smoothly.</p><p>“It was a fight. But it was pretty amazing conditions and I got a report from the coaches and they were like, ‘It’s really attackable, so just go for it,’" she said. "I’ve been in this position before and I’ve given it away and today I wanted to fight for it.”</p><p>Already with eight wins this season, Shiffrin is also quickly approaching Ingemar Stenmark’s overall record — between men and women — of 86 victories.</p><p>Vonn retired four years ago when injuries ended her pursuit of Stenmark's record.</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/sports-mikaela-shiffrin-lindsey-vonn-austria-alpine-skiing-ec3a0095dd2ae28da59e33402c706dee">Vonn wrote in an AP diary</a> that “if anyone is to break my record, I’m really happy that it’s an American.”</p><p>Shiffrin and Vonn now each have 20 more wins than the next woman on the all-time list, Annemarie Moser-Pröll of Austria at 62.</p><p>While the often-injured Vonn required 395 races for her 82 wins, Shiffrin has done it in just 233 races. And at age 27, Shiffrin could compete for several more years and win many more races.</p><p>“I knew from the very beginning that she would be the one to break all the records,” Vonn wrote. “But to be able to do it at such a young age is really impressive.”</p><p>Shiffrin’s achievement comes almost a year after <a href="https://apnews.com/article/winter-olympics-alpine-skiing-mikaela-shiffrin-out-86aee863c85786ed642524434604acf0">a disappointing performance at the Beijing Olympics</a>, when she competed in six events without winning a medal.</p><p>Winning this race, though, never really seemed in doubt.</p><p>On an overcast morning, Shiffrin was the first starter and laid down a much more aggressive opening run than either of her two trips down the steep Podkoren course on Saturday, when she finished in a tie for sixth.</p><p>“I couldn’t ski faster,” Shiffrin said after her first run. “I felt much, much better this first run than yesterday. I had to try to change my feeling from yesterday. It was very good skiing and I’m happy with that.”</p><p>Shiffrin was the last skier to start the second run and increased her advantage at every checkpoint to finish a whopping 0.77 seconds ahead of Italy’s Federica Brignone and 0.97 ahead of Switzerland’s Lara Gut-Behrami.</p><p>“She was almost perfect,” said Brignone, a former overall World Cup champion. “When she’s skiing like that she’s unbeatable.”</p><p>Added Gut-Behrami, the reigning world champion in giant slalom and the Olympic super-G champion, “It’s good to have these athletes that are making history. Without that, we wouldn’t be so addicted to sport.”</p><p>With few American fans at the race near the Italian border, supporters of Slovakian rival Petra Vlhova cheered Shiffrin loudly. A few kids were waving American flags and family members of Paula Moltzan, another American skier, were on hand wearing USA hockey jerseys.</p><p>Shiffrin also moved ahead of Moser-Pröll and Tessa Worley of France with her 17th giant slalom win for second on the women’s career list behind only Vreni Schneider, the Swiss skier who won 20.</p><p>New Zealand skier Alice Robinson was the victim of an ugly fall during her second run, crashing face first into the snow, but she quickly got up and skied to the bottom.</p><p>___</p><p>Andrew Dampf is at https://twitter.com/AndrewDampf</p><p>___</p><p>More AP skiing: https://apnews.com/hub/skiing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports</p>]]></description>

Duesseldorf prosecutors later said an initial search of the premises turned up no toxic substances. </p><p>It wasn't immediately clear how far advanced the plans for an attack were and whether the suspects had picked a specific target, but prosecutors said they would ask a court to keep the men jailed pending further investigation.</p><p>If convicted of jointly arranging a deadly attack, the men — who were identified by prosecutors only as M.J. and J.J. due to German privacy rules — could face between three and 15 years imprisonment.</p><p>German news agency dpa quoted the top security official for North Rhine-Westphalia state, Herbert Reul, as saying authorities had received “a serious tip that led police to intervene the same night.” Duesseldorf prosecutors said the information came from authorities in the United States, but declined to elaborate.</p><div id="afs:Card:827068831206" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="60f78b43bcb21e6aa8b4e43976ec4cb5">Hub peek embed (Crime) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Germany's top security official thanked police and specialists from the country's disease control agency who had taken part in the raid.</p><p>“Our security services take any information about Islamist terror threats very seriously, and act,” Interior Minister Nancy Faser said in a statement, adding that 21 Islamist attacks had been prevented in Germany since the start of the century.</p><p>Faeser noted the importance of international cooperation in fighting extremist threats and said further investigations by Duesseldorf prosecutors would show whether the suspicions that triggered the police operation were warranted.</p><p>Five years ago, German police arrested a Tunisian man and his wife on suspicion of planning to carry out a ricin attack in the name of the Islamic State group. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/islamic-state-group-europe-germany-cologne-biological-weapons-0e62f2a65d958de20c9375a868a2214b">They were later found guilty</a> and sentenced to 10 and eight years’ imprisonment, respectively.</p><p>Even small amounts of ricin, which is produced from the seeds of castor oil plants, can kill an adult if eaten, injected or inhaled.</p>]]></description>

Meanwhile, Jacksonville second-year standout Trevor Lawrence and Seattle veteran Geno Smith will be among at least five quarterbacks making their playoff debuts.</p><p>The schedule is set: In the AFC, it’ll be the Los Angeles Chargers at Jacksonville, Miami at Buffalo and Baltimore at Cincinnati. In the NFC, it's Seattle at San Francisco to begin the playoff slate, followed by the New York Giants at Minnesota and Dallas at Tampa Bay.</p><p>The Seahawks were the last team to make the field <a href="https://apnews.com/article/green-bay-packers-seattle-seahawks-los-angeles-rams-detroit-lions-sports-666251bf430dc399920439443991f297">after Detroit beat Green Bay 20-16 on Sunday night</a>. The Lions were eliminated from playoff contention earlier Sunday when the Seattle beat the Rams, but Detroit pushed past the disappointment to deny Aaron Rodgers and the division rival Packers a spot in the postseason.</p><p>The Lions' win capped a Week 18 that saw the Dolphins make it back to the playoffs for the first time since 2016. The surprising Jaguars also return to the postseason for just the second time since 2007.</p><p>Among those who didn't make the cut: <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-england-patriots-buffalo-bills-miami-dolphins-york-jets-nfl-25243cdf2ceb3780419859fc39537ef4">The New England Patriots</a> and six-time Super Bowl-winning coach Bill Belichick, eliminated after a loss to the Bills.</p><p>The No. 1 overall seed in the AFC was claimed by Kansas City with its 31-13 win over Las Vegas on Saturday. The NFC's top spot was taken by Philadelphia, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/philadelphia-eagles-new-york-giants-sports-jalen-hurts-nfl-football-a80233e214f9e1b60db676bd2e5b6342">which beat the Giants 22-16</a> on Sunday.</p><div id="afs:Card:103854648961" content-id="05b7768e4388d57e68983ceacaedf6ab" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (NFL) - Compressed layout </div><p>Here's a look at some other developments as the postseason approaches: </p><h2>WHAT'S THE WILD-CARD SCHEDULE?</h2><p>SATURDAY</p><p>Seattle Seahawks at San Francisco 49ers, 4:30 p.m. EST, Fox</p><p>Los Angeles Chargers at Jacksonville Jaguars, 8:15 p.m. EST, NBC</p><p>SUNDAY</p><p>Miami Dolphins at Buffalo Bills, 1 p.m. EST, CBS</p><p>New York Giants at Minnesota Vikings, 4:30 p.m. EST, Fox</p><p>Baltimore Ravens at Cincinnati Bengals, 8:15 p.m. EST, NBC</p><p>MONDAY</p><p>Dallas Cowboys at Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 8:15 p.m. EST, ESPN/ABC</p><h2>WHAT'S THE FORMAT FOR THE PLAYOFFS?</h2><p>This is the third straight year of the current NFL playoff format, which includes the top seven teams from both the AFC and the NFC.</p><p>The four division winners in both conferences automatically get the top four seeds, regardless of record, and then the top three teams with the best record that didn't win their division are the wild-card selections. That's why it's fairly common for a wild-card selection to have a better record — but worse playoff seeding — than a team that finished as a division winner.</p><p>The No. 1-seeded team in each conference gets a bye into the second round — that's the Chiefs and Eagles — while No. 2 hosts No. 7, No. 3 hosts No. 6 and No. 4 hosts No. 5 during the wild-card weekend.</p><p>The NFL re-seeds teams after each playoff round. That means no matter how the bracket started, the lowest-seeded team will always travel to the highest-seeded team. </p><p>There are four rounds to the playoffs: The wild-card round is during the upcoming weekend, the divisional round is Jan. 21-22, the conference championship games are on Jan. 29 and the Super Bowl is scheduled for Feb. 12 in Glendale, Arizona.</p><h2>WHAT CHANGED WITH THE BILLS-BENGALS CANCELLATION?</h2><p>Players and fans watched in horror Monday night <a href="https://apnews.com/article/damar-hamlin-collapse-buffalo-bills-cincinnati-bengals-c9f684bdaccd1e3f77bda6c77baca75e">as Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin collapsed</a> on the field at Cincinnati when his heart stopped and had to be given CPR before leaving the field in an ambulance. A few days later, those same players and fans <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-england-patriots-buffalo-bills-sports-nfl-football-damar-hamlin-47dc11b56ec33560542cd3847db4de45">reacted with joy</a> at news of Hamlin's recovery.</p><p>That made it easier to focus on Week 18 and now the playoffs.</p><p>The cancellation of the Bills-Bengals game because of Hamlin's injury could lead to one big change to the AFC playoff format.</p><p>The AFC championship game would be played on a neutral site if the Chiefs and Bills reach that point under a rule adjustment approved by NFL owners last Friday. That's because Buffalo (13-3) played one fewer game than Kansas City (14-3) and missed out on a chance to earn the top seed. The Bills beat the Chiefs 24-20 on Oct. 16 and would have held the tiebreaker had the teams finished with the same record. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/cincinnati-bengals-kansas-city-chiefs-buffalo-bills-nfl-sports-060041ec1dd4c9bea035ca7283fa5e7a">Buffalo lost 42-36 at Kansas City</a> in a divisional-round classic last season.</p><p>The Chiefs would host the AFC title game against any other team, including the third-seeded Bengals (12-4).</p><h2>WHAT ARE THE GOOD WILD-CARD GAMES?</h2><p>There's not a bad matchup in the bunch but a couple stand out.</p><p>— Cowboys at Bucs: Brady suffered through his first losing season in his 23-year career, but even at 8-9, the Bucs won the NFC South. They'll face the Cowboys, who were 12-5 and always attract a white-hot spotlight.</p><p>— Ravens at Bengals: It's the third time these AFC North rivals will meet this season. Former MVP Lamar Jackson could return at quarterback for the Ravens after missing several weeks because of a knee injury. He'll face the Bengals and Joe Burrow, who lost the Super Bowl to the Rams last season.</p><p>— Chargers at Jaguars: This one features two of the NFL's best young quarterbacks, both of whom are making their playoff debuts. Jacksonville's Lawrence took a big step forward in his second season while LA's Justin Herbert has compiled impressive numbers during his three years in the league.</p><p>___</p><p>AP Pro Football Writer Rob Maaddi contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL </p>]]></description>

(Jan. 6)</p>    <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Without a TV show, starry red carpet, host, press or even a livestream, the <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/golden-globe-awards">Golden Globe Awards</a> were in chaos last year after scandal broke over lack of diversity, accusations of sexism, and ethical and financial lapses among members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.</p><p>Once known as Hollywood’s biggest, booziest party that regularly drew 18 million television viewers, the doling out of statues was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/golden-globe-awards-7807652153518b2df70e636dd22654c2">reduced to a 90-minute private event</a> with no celebrities present at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.</p><p>Winners were announced on Twitter, often without specifying what project a person had actually won for.</p><p>What a difference a year can make.</p><p>After dumping the telecast in the aftermath of a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-02-21/hfpa-golden-globes-2021">damaging expose by the Los Angeles Times</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/golden-globes-return-2023-nbc-fd8fefb130eafdad03807a944f25ea1d">NBC will put the battered 80-year-old Globes</a> back on the air Tuesday under a one-year deal, as opposed to multi-year contracts of the past worth tens of millions of dollars. </p><p>A wave of celebrities plan to attend, along with star presenters and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jerrod-carmichael-golden-globes-host-2023-d60e244c609ad4cf23a6789fdeab6a68">funnyman host Jerrod Carmichael</a> after the embattled controllers of the Globes dug deep into the work of implementing top-down reforms.</p><div id="8e30a7417f284b588fdf017ae3de99ff" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>There’s now a strict code of conduct, refreshed bylaws, a ban on gifts and new rules on accepting travel and other perks from the industry. Contentious news conferences were dumped, and the pool of awards voters was expanded beyond the 87 Los Angeles-based foreign journalists who once ruled the organization.</p><div id="afs:Card:038204960080" content-id="9ee1a25e378b0c707dcd1f5f205c405b" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (apf-TV) - Compressed layout (automatic embed)</div><p>But are the powerful publicists, studios and other stakeholders who boycotted in protest satisfied with the changes? And are those changes the beginning — or closer to the end?</p><p>“It's, by far, not over,” said German journalist Helen Hoehne, who took over as president of the HFPA a year and a half ago. “We always said when we started this journey that it would be ongoing and that it would take some time.”</p><p>Kelly Bush Novak, CEO and founder of the A-list public relations firm ID, said more must be done, but she supports steps taken so far.</p><p>“We came together ... to ensure the future of the Globes, in step with our culture and our shared values as an industry, and we see commendable and seismic progress,” she said. "I’m optimistic that the work will continue.” </p><div id="67353cf0c24b4002a97ccd1c5780352f" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Still, Novak acknowledged not all stakeholders are on board ahead of Tuesday's broadcast, despite sweeping changes aimed at restoring the luster of the Globes.</p><p>Last year, publicists like Novak banded together to battle the HFPA, and studios that included Netflix and WarnerMedia cut ties with the organization after the LA Times raised questions about corruption and a range of bias issues over race and sexual orientation.</p><p>None of the 87 Hollywood Foreign Press Association <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-02-21/hfpa-golden-globes-2021-who-are-the-members#:~:text=2021%20Golden%20Globes%20group%20has%20no%20Black%20members%20%2D%20Los%20Angeles%20Times">members was Black</a> and the group had not had a Black member since at least 2002.</p><p>Now, after an effort to increase and diversify its ranks, 199 people decide who gets a Globe, a mix of 96 HFPA members and outsiders from other countries brought in to dilute the power of the old guard. Membership eligibility was expanded from Los Angeles to anywhere in the United States. </p><p>Heading into the telecast, Globes voters stand at 52% female, and 51.8% racially and ethnically diverse, including 19.6% Latino, 12.1% Asian, 10.1% Black and 10.1% Middle Eastern. Voters also include those who are LGBTQIA+. In all, 62 countries are represented.</p><p>The governing board was expanded from nine to 15 and includes three Black members, two of whom vote on rules and other matters but not awards. Overall, the organization now has six Black HFPA members and 14 Black international Globes voters who aren't members.</p><div id="ece237cd65424ddf9cd9b56219e1c5ce" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Perhaps the most significant change: The Globes were purchased by billionaire Todd Boehly, who also owns Globes producer dick clark productions and the Chelsea soccer team and is an investor in the Beverly Hilton. He's shifting the voting body from its founding nonprofit status to a for-profit model, pending approval by the California attorney general. He plans to preserve the HFPA's charitable work with a separate nonprofit entity.</p><p>A hotline managed by two independent law firms was opened, with complaints investigated by outsiders. A chief diversity officer was hired, and mandatory racial, sexual harassment and sexual orientation sensitivity training was put in place, required for any HFPA member casting Globe votes.</p><p>Michelle Williams, nominated for her turn in “The Fabelmans,” is among dozens of stars planning to attend Tuesday.</p><p>“It feels to me like the community as a whole has decided that this organization has really done a lot of work to reform themselves and that we can support change, like we can hold people accountable and then we can support them as they continue to journey in their path towards being a better organization,” she said.</p><p>Added Judd Hirsch, nominated for the same film: “We'll be there. We'll give them another chance.”</p><p>Dumping news conferences at the center of insensitive questions posed to talent who felt obligated to show up helped cool off some critics, but not all.</p><p>“I can’t speak for everyone. There may be some reluctance to participate," Novak said. “We must acknowledge the past and will never forget the damage done. Manifesting a new future requires it.”</p><p>Brendan Fraser, nominated for his performance in “The Whale,” <a href="https://apnews.com/article/brendan-fraser-will-not-attend-2023-golden-globes-d09df6c03e4094acf835ec65d2e8bbaa">will not be there Tuesday</a>. In 2018, Fraser said he was groped by Philip Berk, a former HFPA president who is from South Africa. </p><p>Berk <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-race-and-ethnicity-golden-globe-awards-arts-and-entertainment-2bc2531d105cd4e095119a62de57f9bd">was expelled in 2021</a> after calling Black Lives Matter “a racist hate movement.”</p><p>“I just hope that we can regain his trust over time,” Hoehne said of Fraser.</p><div id="96d6dcc4556544d2bdd65950349e0f29" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>The same, Hoehne said, goes for Tom Cruise. Last year, he returned his three Golden Globes in protest. With a best picture nod for his long-awaited sequel “Top Gun: Maverick,” he was snubbed for best actor this year.</p><p>Under Boehly's leadership, HFPA members will earn $75,000 a year as his employees, as opposed to current stipends closer to $5,000. They'll vote on nominations and winners among films and television series submitted for awards consideration. They'll write for the organization's website, and organize other projects, the LA Times said, citing a confidential employee memo it reviewed. </p><p>The 103 new voting non-members recruited with the help of the National Association of Black Journalists, the Asian American Journalists Association and LGBTQIA+ organizations will not be paid, setting up a two-tier structure aimed at eliminating the taint of financial compensation as more new recruits come on board.</p><p>Outraged industry stakeholders had called for the overall Globes voting body to be closer to 300. Other reforms are aimed at battling the perception of influence peddling.</p><p>As eventual paid employees, members will be subject to firing without cause. They're now required to sign a code of conduct every year covering job performance, decorum and ethical behavior.</p><p>The 80-year-old group had been stuck in its ways, Hoehne acknowledged.</p><p>“We needed to question a lot of things. We needed to look at these bylaws and say, OK, how can we make them better? How can we modernize the association? We had never really done it and not addressed it,” she said.</p><div id="01abf66739ec4ad29949734e8a88118a" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Although the new pay structure has not yet been implemented, over the past year the HFPA has pushed out several members it accused of violating its standards.</p><p>One was accused of forging signatures on Internal Revenue Service documents, another case related to sexual harassment and a third involved fabricating interviews that never occurred, according to an HFPA spokesperson.</p><p>Boehly himself acknowledged the future is uncertain.</p><p>“I have nightmares where it doesn’t work too, you know? I get it, you can’t convince all of the people all of the time of anything,” he told the LA Times. “We know we have to add value and we know that we have to be part of the solution.”</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press Writer Krysta Fauria contributed to this report. </p><p>___</p><p>Follow Leanne Italie on Twitter at http://twitter.com/litalie</p>]]></description>

(BMG/Loma Vista Recordings via AP)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>Here’s a collection curated by The Associated Press’ entertainment journalists of what’s arriving on TV, streaming services and music and video game platforms this week.</p><p>MOVIES</p><p>— In <a href="https://www.pbs.org/pov/films/didntseeyouthere/">“I Didn't See You There,”</a> filmmaker Reid Davenport captures his perspective navigating the world in a wheelchair as a disabled man with cerebral palsy. The film, which premieres Monday as part of PBS's “POV,” is a portrait of the challenges many with disabilities face and their often invisible struggle. (In one scene, Davenport is stuck on an airplane after landing.) But it's also the work of a keenly observant filmmaker, with an eye for beauty and a uniquely poetic point of view. Davenport shot this autobiographical film largely with a handheld camera and, sometimes, with one affixed to his wheelchair. Last year, the film won him the documentary directing prize at the Sundance Film Festival. </p><p>— The title of Sierra Pettengill's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfxelk8-gTU">“Riotsville, USA”</a> refers to a fake town the U.S. military created in the 1960s to hold exercises mimicking police and military response to rioting. The drills, staged in front of cardboard storefronts, helped make a violent playbook for controlling the era's social unrest. “A door swung open in the late ’60s,” reads Charlene Modeste in narration penned by essayist Tobi Haslett. “And someone, something, sprang up and slammed it shut.” Using archival footage from those exercises, “Riotsville, U.S.A,” which debuts Thursday on Hulu, wearily surveys the militarization of the police force.</p><div id="afs:Card:958899307023" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="3920aaa29cc753fc5db2eeabfd6c8602">Hub peek embed (apf-entertainment) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>— Martin Scorsese's monthly series of free virtual screenings of restored classics continues Monday, with George Stevens' sweeping Texas epic “Giant" (1956), with Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson and James Dean. <a href="https://delphiquest.com/film-foundation/restoration-screening-room/giant">A live screening</a>, with commentary, will begin at 7 p.m. EDT.</p><p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/jakecoyleap">AP Film Writer Jake Coyle</a></p><p>MUSIC</p><p>— Alt-country singer-songwriter Margo Price’s fourth studio full-length album, “Strays,” includes the super kiss-off single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8Hvpjui9g8">“Change of Heart,”</a> with the lyrics, “If you break both your legs/Don’t come running to me.” The album features contributions from Sharon Van Etten, Lucius and Mike Campbell, plus the previously released track “Been to the Mountain.” On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RQWYD0-gbE">“Lydia,”</a> Price illustrates the internal strife and self-doubt of a struggling woman who finds herself pregnant and unable to raise a child. The album is released Friday. Want more Price? Check out her new memoir, “Maybe We’ll Make It,” which tracks her early years as an artist in Nashville.</p><p>— “I got gothic babe tendencies/I always choose the dark,” sings up-and-coming singer-songwriter Julia Wolf. Her debut full-length “Good Thing We Stayed” is set to drop on Friday and a highlight is the moody, lovely <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilCI8A0Bm8U">“Gothic Babe Tendencies”</a> featuring blackbear. The Long Island-raised Wolf also leans into her dark side with the smooth and clever single “Dracula” and the lyrics, “I call you Dracula/’Cause most of you people just can’t even look in the mirror.” But she can also be cheeky, as with her sunny anthem <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0R6rDWvrugQ">“Get Off My.”</a></p><p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/kennedytwits?lang=en">Entertainment Writer Mark Kennedy</a></p><p>TELEVISION </p><p>— The team behind the Emmy-nominated HBO docuseries “McMillions” are out with a new investigative series called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUNKmQlKRwU">“Gold, Lies &amp; Videotape.”</a> It’s about a family who claims their ancestors discovered a fortune in gold bars, jewels and coins hidden in a New Mexico cave, now worth billions. Before they could remove it, an accident barricaded the entrance. The land was then blocked off by the government for military use. One man has been pushing for decades to obtain what he believes belongs to his family, because finders keepers, while others wonder if the treasure trove is just a myth. “Gold, Lies &amp; Videotape” delves into this story in six-parts debuting Friday on Discovery Channel and discovery+. The series features images of the treasure plus archival footage and present-day interviews.</p><p>— Andie MacDowell and Chyler Leigh (formerly of “Grey’s Anatomy,”) co-star in a new drama called <a href="https://www.hallmarkchannel.com/the-way-home/videos/first-look-the-way-home">“The Way Home.”</a> The pair play an estranged mother and daughter who haven’t spoken in decades until Leigh’s character’s teen daughter, played by Sadie Laflamme-Snow, brings them together for the first time in 20 years to hopefully repair what’s broken. The 10-episode series debuts Sunday on Hallmark Channel.</p><p>— Alicia Rancilio</p><p>VIDEO GAMES</p><p>— The manga/anime series “One Piece” has spun off dozens of games over the last 25 years, though it hasn’t become quite as popular in America as “Dragon Ball Z” or “Yu-Gi-Oh.” Still, Bandai Namco is hoping to attract franchise fans, as well as aficionados of Japanese role-playing games, with <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/one-piece/one-piece-odyssey">One Piece Odyssey</a>. Monkey D. Luffy, the wannabe King of the Pirates, and his Straw Hat Crew are marooned on a mysterious island and have to figure out how to make their ship, the Thousand Sunny, seaworthy again. The publisher says “One Piece” mastermind Eiichiro Oda contributed the plot, new characters and new monsters to this adventure, and you can climb aboard Friday on the PlayStation 5 and 4, Xbox X/S or PC.</p><p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/lkesten">Lou Kesten</a></p><p>___</p><p>Catch up on AP’s entertainment coverage here: <a href="https://apnews.com/apf-entertainment">https://apnews.com/apf-entertainment.</a></p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Ariana Cubillos, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuela’s opposition has selected an all-female team of mostly unknown exiled former lawmakers to replace the beleaguered Juan Guaidó as the face of its faltering efforts to remove socialist President Nicolas Maduro.</p><p>Last week, politicians who were elected to the National Assembly in 2015 voted <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-europe-venezuela-caribbean-d6ab25309c403544b5b3569b26ab885c">to oust Guaidó from his role as “interim president,”</a> a title he claimed as head of what was widely considered the South American nation's last democratically elected institution.</p><p>On Thursday, those same former lawmakers chose Dinorah Figuera as his replacement. She'll be joined by two other backbenchers — Marianela Fernández and Auristela Vásquez — in a triumvirate leadership of a legislature that operates as a symbolic shadow to Maduro’s rubber-stamping National Assembly, which convened Thursday in its neoclassical chambers.</p><p>The women represent three different parties that had been pushing for Guaidó's removal as a way to reconnect with disillusioned voters ahead of next year's presidential elections. But it remains to see how, living outside Venezuela, they will manage to mobilize their compatriots to counter Maduro's increasingly firm grip on power.</p><p>Figuera, a medical surgeon who has been living in Spain, appealed for unity in her first address to fellow Maduro opponents. She also promised to work to shield the OPEC nation's extensive oil assets abroad, which include Houston-based refinery Citgo, from seizure by a long list of creditors stiffed by Maduro's profligate spending over the years. </p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="000642741a10bef98ba407b1a4c008c9">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“I have the conviction that this parliament will raise the flag of faith, hope and justice,” Figuera said in the session, which was held virtually, in a Zoom meeting, because so many opposition politicians like her have fled Venezuela in recent years.</p><p>In January 2019, the National Assembly, then controlled by the opposition, voted to stop recognizing Maduro as president after several top opponents were barred from running against him. It then appointed Guaidó, who was one of the few leaders in his Popular Will party to avoid arrest or exile, to be the nation’s “interim president,” in accordance with the order of succession outlined in Venezuela’s constitution.</p><p>Guaidó was quickly recognized as Venezuela’s legitimate leader by the United States and dozens of governments in Europe and Latin America. </p><p>But his interim government was unable to win over the military, the traditional arbiter of political disputes in Venezuela, and the opposition-controlled National Assembly's five-year mandate officially ended at the close of 2020. With leftist leaders winning elections across Latin America in recent years, the U.S.-led international coalition to pressure Maduro has also frayed. Colombia, Brazil and Spain are among the countries that recently re-established diplomatic ties. </p><p>Guaidó, in Thursday’s meeting, thanked his many supporters, both domestic and foreign, in what was something akin to a farewell address. Standing at a lectern emblazoned with the Venezuelan presidential seal, the 39-year-old said he would remain in Venezuela — despite calls for his arrest from among Maduro's more radical supporters — and urged his successors to rebuild the unity needed to unseat Maduro.</p><p>“We can’t generate a power vacuum that only benefits the de-facto dictator,” he said. </p><p>Guaidó's departure from the political scene may only be temporary however.</p><p>Although no longer the harbinger of hope he was when he rose from obscurity amid a wave of street protests to challenge Maduro's rule, he remains a popular figure in the otherwise rudderless opposition, admired for his bravery and commitment to the cause of Venezuela's democracy if not for always delivering results. He's expected to be among those who will compete in opposition primaries this year to see who runs against Maduro in 2024.</p><p>Meanwhile, Maduro's supporters seemed to be relishing the opposition's squabbles. </p><p>At Thursday's session inaugurating the legislative year, loyalist lawmakers re-elected Jorge Rodriguez to lead the National Assembly. Rodriguez, a close Maduro ally, accused the opposition of causing imposing undue “pain, suffering and aggression against the Venezuelan people” by supporting U.S. sanctions on the country. </p><p>Socialist party boss Diosdado Cabello also took a shot at the rival legislature, saying: “They love to live in a fantasy, they love to live dreaming.” </p><p>The Biden administration has largely tried to avoid wading into the opposition's feuding while continuing to pressure Maduro to make meaningful concessions to the opposition in negotiations taking place in Mexico that would pave the way for free and fair elections. </p><p>U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said Tuesday that the U.S. stands ready to work with any individual, or collective body, chosen by the 2015 National Assembly to represent it. </p><p>“Our approach to Nicolás Maduro has not changed,” Price said Tuesday. “He is illegitimate. We support the 2015 National Assembly as the only remaining vestige of democracy in Venezuela.”</p><p>___</p><p>Goodman reported from Miami.</p>]]></description>
