Ours is interesting because it's a latent diffusion model instead of a language model, which makes it more controllable: \u003ca href=\"https://sonauto.ai/\"\u003ehttps://sonauto.ai/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eOthers do music generation by training a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder like Descript Audio Codec (\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/descriptinc/descript-audio-codec\"\u003ehttps://github.com/descriptinc/descript-audio-codec\u003c/a\u003e) to turn music into tokens, then training an LLM on those tokens. Instead, we ripped the tokenization part off and replaced it with a normal variational autoencoder bottleneck (along with some other important changes to enable insane compression ratios). This gave us a nice, normally distributed latent space on which to train a diffusion transformer (like Sora). Our diffusion model is also particularly interesting because it is the first audio diffusion model to generate coherent lyrics!\u003cp\u003eWe like diffusion models for music generation because they have some interesting properties that make controlling them easier (so you can make \u003ci\u003eyour own\u003c/i\u003e music instead of just taking what the machine gives you). For example, we have a rhythm control mode where you can upload your own percussion line or set a BPM. Very soon you'll also be able to generate proper variations of an uploaded or previously generated song (e.g., you could even sing into Voice Memos for a minute and upload that!). @Musicians of HN, try uploading your songs and using Rhythm Control/let us know what you think! Our goal is to enable more of you, not replace you.\u003cp\u003eFor example, we turned this drum line (\u003ca href=\"https://sonauto.ai/songs/uoTKycBghUBv7wA2YfNz\"\u003ehttps://sonauto.ai/songs/uoTKycBghUBv7wA2YfNz\u003c/a\u003e) into this full song (\u003ca href=\"https://sonauto.ai/songs/KSK7WM1PJuz1euhq6lS7\"\u003ehttps://sonauto.ai/songs/KSK7WM1PJuz1euhq6lS7\u003c/a\u003e skip to 1:05 if impatient) or this other song I like better (\u003ca href=\"https://sonauto.ai/songs/qkn3KYv0ICT9kjWTmins\"\u003ehttps://sonauto.ai/songs/qkn3KYv0ICT9kjWTmins\u003c/a\u003e - we accidentally compressed it with AAC instead of Opus which hurt quality, though)\u003cp\u003eWe also like diffusion models because while they're expensive to train, they're cheap to serve. We built our own efficient inference infrastructure instead of using those expensive inference as a service startups that are all the rage. That's why we're making generations on our site free and unlimited for as long as possible.\u003cp\u003eWe'd love to answer your questions. Let us know what you think of our first model! \u003ca href=\"https://sonauto.ai/\"\u003ehttps://sonauto.ai/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca

HN: CompressX, my FFmpeg wrapper for macOS","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHey HN, just wanted to share my success story with CompressX, my FFmpeg wrapper for macOS.\u003cp\u003eFor those who may not be familiar, FFmpeg is a powerful tool for converting, streaming, and recording audio and video content.\u003cp\u003eI started CompressX as a weekend project to serve my 9-5 jobs, primarily to compress demo videos for uploading to GitLab and sharing with my colleagues. It took me 2 weeks to make the first working version. I shared the demo on Twitter and the reaction was extraordinary. People loved it, they said that I was bringing the Pied Piper to life.\u003cp\u003eFour months later, I hit the $9,000 mark in revenue. I never expected to make a dime from this project, let alone eight thousand dollars. It's been a surreal experience, but it's also been incredibly rewarding.\u003cp\u003eI put a lot of time and effort into developing this tool, and it's amazing to see it paying off. It's been a great journey so far and I'm excited to see where it takes me next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39987579\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39987579\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 143\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 133\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://compressx.app","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39987579","date_published":"2024-04-10T06:32:18Z","author":{"name":"hieu_dinh","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hieu_dinh"}}]}
