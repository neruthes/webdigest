HN: Aide, an open-source AI native IDE","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHey HN, We are Sandeep and Naresh, the creators of Aide. We are happy to open source and invite the community to try out Aide which is a VSCode fork built with LLMs integrated.\u003cp\u003eTo talk through the features, we engineered the following:\u003cp\u003e- A proactive agent\u003cp\u003eAgent which iterates on the linter errors (powered by the Language Server) and pulls in relevant context by doing go-to-definitions, go-to-references etc and propose fixes or ask for more files which might be missing in the context.\u003cp\u003e- Developer control\u003cp\u003eWe encourage you to do edits on top of your coding sessions. To enable this, we built a VSCode native rollback feature which gets rid of all the edits made by the agent in a single click if there were mistakes, without messing up your changes from before.\u003cp\u003e- A combined chat+edit flow which you can use to brainstorm and edit\u003cp\u003eYou can brainstorm a problem in chat by @’ting the files and then jump into edits (which can happen across multiple files) or go from a smaller set of edits and discuss the side-effects of it\u003cp\u003e- Inline editing widget\u003cp\u003eWe took inspiration from the macos spotlight widget and created a similar one inside the editor, you can highlight part of the code, do Cmd+K and just give your instructions freely\u003cp\u003e- Local running AI brain\u003cp\u003eWe ship a binary called sidecar which takes care of talking to the LLM providers, preparing the prompts and using the editor for the LLM. All of this is local first and you get full control over the prompts/responses without anything leaking to our end (unless you choose to use your subscription and share the data with us)\u003cp\u003eWe spent the last 15 months learning about the internals of VSCode (its a non-trivial codebase) and also powering up our AI game, the framework is also at the top of swebench-lite with 43% score.\nOn top of this, since the whole AI side of the logic runs locally on  your machine you have complete control over the data, from the prompt to the responses and you can use your own API Keys as well (can be any LLM provider) and talk to them directly.\u003cp\u003eThere’s still a whole lot to build and we are at 1% of the journey. Right now the editor feels robust and does not break on any of the flows which we aimed to solve for.\u003cp\u003eLet us know if there’s anything else you would like to see us build. We also want to empower extensibility and work together with the community to build the next set of features and set a new milestone of AI native editors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca
