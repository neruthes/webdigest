HN: Sowbot – open-hardware agricultural robot (ROS2, RTK GPS)","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eSowbot is an open-hardware agricultural robot designed to close the \"prototype gap\" that kills most agri-robotics startups and research projects — the 18+ months spent on drivers, networking, safety watchdogs, and UI before you can even start on the thing you actually care about.\u003cp\u003eThe hardware is built around a stackable 10×10cm compute module with two ARM Cortex-A55 SBCs — one for ROS 2 navigation/EKF localisation, one dedicated to vision/YOLO inference — connected via a single ethernet cable.\u003cp\u003eCentimetre-level positioning via dual RTK GNSS, CAN bus for field comms, and real-time motor control via ESP32 running Lizard firmware.\u003cp\u003eEverything — schematics, PCB layouts, firmware — is under open licences.\nThe software stack runs on RoSys/Field Friend (for teams who want fast iteration) or DevKit ROS (for teams already in the ROS ecosystem). The idea is that a lab in one country can reproduce another lab's experiment by sharing a Docker image.\u003cp\u003eCurrent status: the Open Core brain is largely fabricated, the full-size Sowbot body has a detailed BOM but isn't yet assembled, and we have two smaller dev platforms (Mini and Pico) in various stages of testing.\u003cp\u003eWe're a small volunteer team and we're looking for contributors — hardware, ROS, firmware, docs, whatever you can offer.\u003cp\u003eThe best place to start is our Discord: \u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/SvztEBr4KZ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://discord.gg/SvztEBr4KZ\u003c/a\u003e — we have a weekly call if you'd prefer to just show up and chat.\u003cp\u003eGitHub: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Agroecology-Lab/feldfreund_devkit_ros/tree/caatinga-dev\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://github.com/Agroecology-Lab/feldfreund_devkit_ros/tre...\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47123894\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47123894\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 103\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 35\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://sowbot.co.uk/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47123894","date_published":"2026-02-23T15:48:33Z","author":{"name":"Sabrees","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Sabrees"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47123631","title":"Show HN: PgDog – Scale Postgres without changing the app","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHey HN! Lev and Justin here, authors of PgDog (\u003ca href=\"https://pgdog.dev/\"\u003ehttps://pgdog.dev/\u003c/a\u003e), a connection pooler, load balancer and database sharder for PostgreSQL. If you build apps with a lot of traffic, you know the first thing to break is the database. We are solving this with a network proxy that works without requiring application code changes or database migrations.\u003cp\u003eOur post from last year: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44099187\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44099187\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe most important update: we are in production. Sharding is used a lot, with direct-to-shard  queries (one shard per query) working pretty much all the time. Cross-shard (or multi-database) queries are still a work in progress, but we are making headway.\u003cp\u003eAggregate functions like count(), min(), max(), avg(), stddev() and variance() are working, without refactoring the app. PgDog calculates the aggregate in-transit, while transparently rewriting queries to fetch any missing info. For example, multi-database average calculation requires a total count of rows to calculate the original sum. PgDog will add count() to the query, if it’s not there already, and remove it from the rows sent to the app.\u003cp\u003eSorting and grouping works, including DISTINCT, if the columns(s) are referenced in the result. Over 10 data types are supported, like, timestamp(tz), all integers, varchar, etc.\u003cp\u003eCross-shard writes, including schema changes (CREATE/DROP/ALTER), are now atomic and synchronized between all shards with two-phase commit. PgDog keeps track of the transaction state internally and will rollback the transaction if the first phase fails. You don’t need to monkeypatch your ORM to use this: PgDog will intercept the COMMIT statement and execute PREPARE TRANSACTION and COMMIT PREPARED instead.\u003cp\u003eOmnisharded tables, a.k.a replicated or mirrored (identical on all shards), support atomic reads and writes. That’s important because most databases can’t be completely sharded and will have some common data on all databases that has to be kept in-sync.\u003cp\u003eMulti-tuple inserts, e.g., INSERT INTO table_x VALUES ($1, $2), ($3, $4), are split by our query rewriter and distributed to their respective shards automatically. They are used by ORMs like Prisma, Sequelize, and others, so those now work without code changes too.\u003cp\u003eSharding keys can be mutated. PgDog will intercept and rewrite the update statement into 3 queries, SELECT, INSERT, and DELETE, moving the row between shards. If you’re using Citus (for everyone else, Citus is a Postgres extension for sharding databases), this might be worth a look.\u003cp\u003eIf you’re like us and prefer integers to UUIDs for your primary keys, we built a cross-shard unique sequence, directly inside PgDog. It uses the system clock (and a couple other inputs), can be called like a Postgres function, and will automatically inject values into queries, so ORMs like ActiveRecord will continue to work out of the box. It’s monotonically increasing, just like a real Postgres sequence, and can generate up to 4 million numbers per second with a range of 69.73 years, so no need to migrate to UUIDv7 just yet.\u003cp\u003e\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e    INSERT INTO my_table (id, created_at) VALUES (pgdog.unique_id(), now());\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\nResharding is now built-in. We can move gigabytes of tables per second, by parallelizing logical replication streams across replicas. This is really cool! Last time we tried this at Instacart, it took over two weeks to move 10 TB between two machines. Now, we can do this in just a few hours, in big part thanks to the work of the core team that added support for logical replication slots to streaming replicas in Postgres 16.\u003cp\u003eSharding hardly works without a good load balancer. PgDog can monitor replicas and move write traffic to a promoted primary during a failover. This works with managed Postgres, like RDS (incl. Aurora), Azure Pg, GCP Cloud SQL, etc., because it just polls each instance with “SELECT pg_is_in_recovery()”. Primary election is not supported yet, so if you’re self-hosting with Patroni, you should keep it around for now, but you don’t need to run HAProxy in front of the DBs anymore.\u003cp\u003eThe load balancer is getting pretty smart and can handle edge cases like SELECT FOR UPDATE and CTEs with INSERT/UPDATE statements, but if you still prefer to handle your read/write separation in code, you can do that too with manual routing. This works by giving PgDog a hint at runtime: a connection parameter (-c pgdog.role=primary), SET statement, or a query comment. If you have multiple connection pools in your app, you can replace them with just one connection to PgDog instead. For multi-threaded Python/Ruby/Go apps, this helps by reducing memory usage, I/O and context switching overhead.\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of connection pooling, PgDog can automatically rollback unfinished transactions and drain and re-sync partially sent queries, all in an effort to preserve connections to the database. If you’ve seen Postgres go to 100% CPU because of a connection storm caused by an application crash, this might be for you. Draining connections works by receiving and discarding rows from abandoned queries and sending the Sync message via the Postgres wire protocol, which clears the query context and returns the connection to a normal state.\u003cp\u003ePgDog is open source and welcomes contributions and feedback in any form. As always, all features are configurable and can be turned off/on, so should you choose to give it a try, you can do so at your own pace. Our docs (\u003ca href=\"https://docs.pgdog.dev\"\u003ehttps://docs.pgdog.dev\u003c/a\u003e) should help too.\u003cp\u003eThanks for reading and happy
