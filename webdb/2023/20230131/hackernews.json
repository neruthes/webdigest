HN: LinkedIn sent me a cease and desist for my Chrome extension. Help?","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHi HN,\u003cp\u003eI'm the creator and solo developer behind Browserflow, a Chrome extension that lets you automate any website. (Show HN from around a year ago: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29254147). Basically, it's a general-purpose browser automation tool like Selenium/Puppeteer/Playwright that anyone can use without writing code.\u003cp\u003eThe Browserflow website includes examples of automations people often request, including scraping popular websites like LinkedIn. A few days ago, I received a cease and desist letter from LinkedIn: https://browserflow.app/linkedin.pdf\u003cp\u003eAs a one-man operation with modest resources, I'm hoping I can get some help from the HN community in understanding what this means to avoid getting sued into oblivion. :)\u003cp\u003eAt first I thought that I'd be fine if I removed all references to LinkedIn from the Browserflow website, but I'm not so sure about that. One of LinkedIn's demands is to “Cease and desist developing, offering, or using software or programs with features developed, marketed, or intended for automating activity on LinkedIn’s website or app, scraping LinkedIn member data, or otherwise violating the LinkedIn User Agreement”.\u003cp\u003eEven if I removed all the LinkedIn examples, Browserflow could still be used to automate or scrape LinkedIn because, well, it's a browser automation tool. Is LinkedIn demanding that I stop developing Browserflow altogether?\u003cp\u003eThe letter cites hiQ Labs, Inc. v. LinkedIn Corp as the legal precedent for why Browserflow is in violation, but there are some differences between hiQ and Browserflow that I thought might be meaningful:\u003cp\u003e1. Browserflow is not designed specifically for scraping LinkedIn: It's a tool for general-purpose browser automation, not a service that scrapes LinkedIn and resells the data.\u003cp\u003e2. Browserflow does not scrape LinkedIn on its own: Any automation of LinkedIn is initiated by the user using their own LinkedIn account.\u003cp\u003e2. Browserflow does not create or use fake LinkedIn accounts.\u003cp\u003eI'd be fine with removing all the LinkedIn examples from the website, but I'd like to continue building Browserflow because I love working on it and it's my livelihood. I'd appreciate any advice or help. Thanks!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca

I have high problem solving competence in general, but most modern technology stacks people are regularly using seem to be past my time. I'm willing to put some work into correcting the difference, however due to the circumstances I'm in, it would really have to quickly and effectively pay off. It can't be a \"maybe useful\" kind of scenario.\u003cp\u003eI've come into a situation, largely due to how awful the rent situation is in the United States, where I pretty desperately need to maximize the amount I can earn under disability (which is around $1200 a month) without losing it.\u003cp\u003eI have 8-10 years of overall experience, and regularly program as a hobby, but I have not been employed for years.\u003cp\u003eThe last job I worked I primarily wrote python scripts for automating things like data entry into a CMS and other basic front-end web development features using older technology.\u003cp\u003eWhat can I do to actually be able to get some side income in the software space here in 2023? I've talked with a couple companies in my situation and the answers usually are along the lines of \"well we can just hire a new graduate with up-to-date experience and they can work 40 hours a week for us no problem.\"\u003cp\u003eI'm in my early-to-mid 30s for reference. I'm not really able to get off disability as the condition is severe.\u003cp\u003e---\u003cp\u003eedit:\nI've already reduced expenses pretty much as much as I reasonably can do of course.\u003cp\u003eI've explored other options already as well. For things like Fiverr or being hired contract-wise on websites they seem to be races to the bottom so if I'm trying to earn $1200 a month I'm really having to work quite a lot harder and more hours than I'm really currently able to do.\u003cp\u003eI have some applications I've written that generated some interest, however if I want to make any decent money off them I would have to put an extraordinarily large amount of effort into marketing and post-release diligence which may well be past what I'm currently capable of doing.\u003cp\u003eI do tutor students as well intermittenly but it doesn't get me very much.\u003cp\u003eI've written some scripts and other little projects for people I know here and there for small amounts, but it is extremely inconsistent availability even though they trust what I deliver.\u003cp\u003eIt seems like finding other leads in that regard is really my only option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34578347\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34578347\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 219\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 183\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34578347","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34578347","date_published":"2023-01-30T11:20:08Z","author":{"name":"Madmallard","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Madmallard"}}]}
