Watch this video: \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/6rVD5rmrjN8\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/6rVD5rmrjN8\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eVisual DB is a comprehensive SaaS frontend for your database. In addition to data entry forms, Visual DB also has a spreadsheet-like interface for inserting and updating data in your database. You can also build interactive reports using Visual DB. Finally, although not intended as a replacement for your database's admin tool, Visual DB can browse schema, create tables, set up relationships, and import and export data.\u003cp\u003eVisual DB began as a drag-and-drop form builder for databases. Forms created with Visual DB are practically indistinguishable from those hand-coded using React. You can add client-side validation, set available values (displayed in dropdowns), define default values, and even add logic to dynamically hide or disable fields—all without writing a single line of code! With Visual DB Forms, you’ll never have to write another CRUD app again.\u003cp\u003eIf you have been using Excel to manage data and running into its limits because the volume of data has grown, Visual DB Sheets may be of interest to you. With its spreadsheet-like interface, Visual DB Sheets allows users to interact with data as they would in Excel, while securely storing that data in a robust relational database. Spreadsheet-database hybrids have been around for a while now, but we believe we have one of the best implementations, with features such as advanced grouping, support for foreign keys and lookup tables, query parameters, full-text as-you-type filtering, and so on.\u003cp\u003eThe newest feature of Visual DB is interactive reporting. Traditional reporting tools offer limited interactivity. For example, while most reporting tools support time series charts, they do not allow users to zoom or pan along the time axis. In contrast, Visual DB supports this capability thanks to its innovative approach: it downloads the dataset to the client and processes and visualizes data directly in the browser. This allows it to handle user interactions without a server round trip. Visual DB has excellent support for query parameters, which allows you to bring only the subset of data that's of interest (up to 100K rows), to the client.\u003cp\u003eVisual DB supports PostgreSQL (including Neon), MySQL, SQL Server and Oracle. Give it a whirl, and we look forward to getting your feedback: \u003ca href=\"https://visualdb.com\"

HN: YourNextStore – an open-source Shopify with Stripe as the back end","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re building Your Next Store, a modern, ultra-fast, open-source commerce in Next.js with Stripe as the backend - no DB required.\u003cp\u003eSelling online is often more complex than it needs to be. Setting up a storefront with great performance can feel daunting and time-consuming. There are many plugins, libraries, etc - the choice can be overwhelming.\u003cp\u003ePlus, in e-commerce, the backend and frontend are often written in different languages (e.g., PHP, Python, or Ruby for the backend). This increases the complexity and makes code management more challenging, especially for teams.\u003cp\u003eAfter working in e-commerce for several years, Michał and I set out to build the fastest and most compelling storefront for small to medium-sized merchants. Fast e-commerce sites are crucial because slow pages hurt sales [1]. Unfortunately, performance issues are still very common. The beauty of Your Next Store is its simplicity. No additional tools and no databases - just Next.js and Stripe.\u003cp\u003eOn the technical side, we use App Router, React Server Component, Partial Pre-Rendering, Optimistic Updates, and Streaming with Suspense to make the store faster and leaner so it feels almost like a static website.\u003cp\u003eIn summary:\u003cp\u003eModern \u0026 Popular Stack: Built with Next.js, React.js, and TypeScript, making development faster and hiring easier compared to platforms that use less common frameworks like Shopify’s Liquid.\u003cp\u003eNo Database Needed: Stripe handles the backend, reducing the need for complex infrastructure and simplifying the setup process.\u003cp\u003eOpen Source: Free and open (AGPL), with the option for a commercial license if needed.\u003cp\u003eThis is just the beginning. We want to make YNS even better and easier to use and eventually provide a good, open-source alternative to Shopify.\u003cp\u003eCheck our code at \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/yournextstore/yournextstore\"\u003ehttps://github.com/yournextstore/yournextstore\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback!
