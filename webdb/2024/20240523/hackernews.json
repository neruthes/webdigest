HN: Neosync – Open-Source Data Anonymization for Postgres and MySQL","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHey HN, we're Evis and Nick and we're excited to be launching Neosync (\u003ca href=\"https://www.github.com/nucleuscloud/neosync\"\u003ehttps://www.github.com/nucleuscloud/neosync\u003c/a\u003e). Neosync is an open source platform that helps developers anonymize production data, generate synthetic data and sync it across their environments for better testing, debugging and developer experience.\u003cp\u003eMost developers and teams have some version of a database seed script that creates some mock data for their local and stage databases. The problem is that production data is messy and it’s very difficult to replicate that with mock data. This causes two big problems for developers.\u003cp\u003eThe first problem is that features seem to work locally/stage but have bugs and edge cases in production because the seed data you used to develop against was not representative of production data.\u003cp\u003eThe second problem we saw was that debugging production errors would take a long time and would often resurface. When we see a bug in production, the first thing we want to do is reproduce it locally, but if we can’t reproduce the state of the data locally, then we’re kind of flying blind.\u003cp\u003eWorking directly with production data would solve both of these problems but most teams can’t because of: (1) privacy/security issues and (2) scale. So we set out to solve these two problems with Neosync.\u003cp\u003eWe solve the privacy and security problem using anonymization and synthetic data. We have 40+ pre-built transformers (or you can write your own in code) that can anonymize PII or sensitive data so that it’s safe to use locally. Additionally, you can generate synthetic data from scratch that fits your existing schema across your database.\u003cp\u003eThe second problem is scale. Some production databases are too big to fit locally or just have more data than you need. Also, in some cases, you may want to debug a certain customer’s data and you only want their data. We solve this with subsetting. You can pass in a SQL query to filter your table(s) and Neosync will handle all of the heavy lifting including referential integrity.\u003cp\u003eAt the core of Neosync does three things:  (1) It streams data from a source to one or multiple destination databases. We never store your sensitive data. (2) While that data is being streamed, we transform it. You define which schemas and tables you want to sync and at the column level, select a transformer that defines how you want to anonymize the data or generate synthetic data. (3) We subset your data based on your filters.\u003cp\u003eWe do all of this while handling referential integrity. Whether you have primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, circular dependencies (within a table and across tables), sequences and more, Neosync preserves those references.\u003cp\u003eWe also ship with APIs, a Terraform provider, a CLI and Github action that you can use to hydrate a CI database.\u003cp\u003eNeosync is an open source project written in Go and Typescript and can be run on Docker Compose, Bare Metal, or Kubernetes via Helm. You can also use our hosted platform or managed platform that you can deploy in your VPC. We also have a hosted platform with a generous free tier - \u003ca href=\"https://neosync.dev\"\u003ehttps://neosync.dev\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere's a brief loom demo:  \u003ca href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/ac21378d01cd4d848cf723e4960e8338?sid=2faf613c-92be-44fa-9278-c8087e777356\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.loom.com/share/ac21378d01cd4d848cf723e4960e8338?...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe'd love any feedback you have!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40443927\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40443927\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 119\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 27\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://github.com/nucleuscloud/neosync","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40443927","date_published":"2024-05-22T17:53:45Z","author":{"name":"edrenova","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=edrenova"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40443907","title":"One-third of Amazon warehouse workers are on food stamps or Medicaid","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/DanPriceSeattle/status/1791299631558823954\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/DanPriceSeattle/status/1791299631558823954\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40443907\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40443907\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 297\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 353\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://twitter.com/DanPriceSeattle/status/1791299631558823954","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40443907","date_published":"2024-05-22T17:52:21Z","author":{"name":"ZuckMusk","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ZuckMusk"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40443682","title":"Windows Recall sounds like a privacy nightmare","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://www.techradar.com/computing/computing-security/windows-recall-sounds-like-a-privacy-nightmare-heres-why-im-worried\"\u003ehttps://www.techradar.com/computing/computing-security/windows-recall-sounds-like-a-privacy-nightmare-heres-why-im-worried\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40443682\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40443682\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 208\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 198\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.techradar.com/computing/computing-security/windows-recall-sounds-like-a-privacy-nightmare-heres-why-im-worried","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40443682","date_published":"2024-05-22T17:33:21Z","author":{"name":"segasaturn","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=segasaturn"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40443558","title":"Systematically Improving Your RAG","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://jxnl.co/writing/2024/05/22/systematically-improving-your-rag/\"\u003ehttps://jxnl.co/writing/2024/05/22/systematically-improving-your-rag/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40443558\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40443558\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 115\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 40\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://jxnl.co/writing/2024/05/22/systematically-improving-your-rag/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40443558","date_published":"2024-05-22T17:22:27Z","author":{"name":"jxnlco","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jxnlco"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40442595","title":"Pluckable Strings","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://string.spiel.com/\"\u003ehttps://string.spiel.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40442595\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40442595\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 412\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 94\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://string.spiel.com/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40442595","date_published":"2024-05-22T16:05:06Z","author":{"name":"bcjordan","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bcjordan"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40441093","title":"Show HN: PBT – A property-based testing library for Ruby","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHello HN,\u003cp\u003eI introduce a property-based testing tool for Ruby.\nRuby's ease of test-writing and rich ecosystem are widely acclaimed.
