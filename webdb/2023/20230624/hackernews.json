I have then connected to a no internet VLAN with an NVR.\u003cp\u003eThe models I've been using have an ethernet port and wifi. Setup was connecting to the ethernet port and then accessing the web ui in a browser to configure settings (most importantly turning on RTSP or ONVIF feeds). The cameras I have are starting to show their age and a couple of them are starting to fail (PTZ slow or require reboots every few weeks).\u003cp\u003eI picked up newer models from Amcrest and foscam assuming they would have the same set up procedure (i made sure to get ethernet+wifi models and did research on being RSTP capable) but they all require downloading an app and creating an account to set them up, even if the end configuration is without internet for local video)\u003cp\u003eThe foscam cameras have a web ui that just has links to the app stores and the amcrest cameras don't have any web ui available. I tried directly accessing the RTSP URLs and still no luck. both apps require account creation in order to use.\u003cp\u003eI've also tried some tp link, wyze and aqara cameras in the past but they all required an app/account. They also had the worst reliability, both in connection stability and physical failure rates.\u003cp\u003eDoes anyone have specific model numbers of currently purchasable (US) IP cameras that genuinely don't require an app and account to set up?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36447024\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36447024\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 304\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 176\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36447024","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36447024","date_published":"2023-06-23T14:08:15Z","author":{"name":"POCKET_SANDO","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=POCKET_SANDO"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36446933","title":"Windows NT on 600MHz machine opens apps instantly.

HN: An open-source, collaborative, WYSIWYG Markdown editor","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eInspired by the design and UI/UX of apps like Notion, and utility of open-source apps like StackEdit, I decided to create a minimalistic, local-only WYSIWYG Markdown editor.\u003cp\u003eSome features worth highlighting:\u003cp\u003e- Monaco editor and Prettier integration for code snippets\u003cp\u003e- Tables (apparently the holy grail of WYSIWYG editing)\u003cp\u003e- Embeds (for CodePen, CodeSandbox and YouTube, most useful for HTML or JSON exports)\u003cp\u003e- Accepts Markdown paste-in, and \"exports\"/generates HTML, Markdown and JSON outputs\u003cp\u003e- Collaboration (with real-time awareness and initial commenting system, available only when logged in)\u003cp\u003e- GPT-3.5 integration (only when logged-in with the corresponding extension installed)\u003cp\u003eStack used: TipTap, Solid.js, HocusPocus, Fastify, tRPC.\u003cp\u003eSome notable drawbacks:\u003cp\u003e- No mobile support\u003cp\u003e- Collaboration available only between signed-in users, in the same workspace;\u003cp\u003e- I tried my best to support most common Markdown formatting, pasting and in-editor shortcuts, though there might still be room for improvement\u003cp\u003e- Self-hosting isn't easy right now, though you should be able to figure it out from the source code\u003cp\u003eThe editor itself is a standalone app, extracted from the larger Vrite CMS project (\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/vriteio/vrite\"\u003ehttps://github.com/vriteio/vrite\u003c/a\u003e) which you can
