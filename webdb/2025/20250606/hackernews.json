Mike \u0026 Warren here from HyperDX (now part of ClickHouse)! We’ve been building ClickStack, an open source observability stack that helps you collect, centralize, search/viz/alert on your telemetry (logs, metrics, traces) in just a few minutes - all powered by ClickHouse (Apache2) for storage, HyperDX (MIT) for visualization and OpenTelemetry (Apache2) for ingestion.\u003cp\u003eYou can check out the quick start for spinning things up in the repo here: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/hyperdxio/hyperdx\"\u003ehttps://github.com/hyperdxio/hyperdx\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eClickStack makes it really easy to instrument your application so you can go from bug reports of “my checkout didn’t go through” to a session replay of the user, backend API calls, to DB queries and infrastructure metrics related to that specific request in a single view.\u003cp\u003eFor those that might be migrating from Very Expensive Observability Vendor (TM) to something open source, more performant, and doesn’t require extensive culling of retention limits and sampling rates - ClickStack gives a batteries-included way of starting that migration journey.\u003cp\u003eFor those that aren’t familiar with ClickHouse, it’s a high performance database that has already been used by companies such as Anthropic, Cloudflare, and DoorDash to power their core observability at scale due to its flexibility, ease of use, and cost effectiveness. However, this required teams to dedicate engineers to building a custom observability stack, where it’s difficult to not only get their telemetry data easily into ClickHouse but also struggling without a native UI experience.\u003cp\u003eThat’s why we’re building ClickStack - we wanted to bundle an easy way to get started ingesting your telemetry data whether it’s logs \u0026 traces from Node.js or Ruby to metrics from Kubernetes or your bare metal infrastructure. Just as important we wanted our users to enjoy a visualization experience that allowed users to quickly search using a familiar lucene-like search syntax (similar to what you’d use in Google!). We recognise though, that a SQL mode is needed for the most complex of queries. We've also added high cardinality outlier analysis by charting the delta between outlier and inlier events - which we've found really helpful in narrowing down causes of regressions/anomalies in our traces as well as log patterns to condense down clusters of similar logs.\u003cp\u003eWe’re really excited about the roadmap ahead in terms of improving ClickStack as a product and the ClickHouse core database to improve observability. Would love to hear everyone’s feedback and what they think!\u003cp\u003eSpinning up a container is pretty simple: `docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 4317:4317 -p 4318:4318

Lab – A portable and open air quality measuring device","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHi HN!\u003cp\u003eI’ve been working on an air quality measuring device called Air Lab for the past three years. It measures CO2, temperature, relative humidity, air pollutants (VOC, NOx), and atmospheric pressure. You can log and analyze the data directly on the device — no smartphone or laptop needed.\u003cp\u003eTo better show what the device can do and how it feels like, I spent the past week developing a web-based simulator using Emscripten. It runs the stock firmware with most features available except for networking. Check it out and let me know what you think!\u003cp\u003eThe firmware will be open-source and available once the first batch of devices ships. We’re currently finishing up our crowdfunding campaign on CrowdSupply. If you want to get one, now is the time to support the project: \u003ca href=\"https://www.crowdsupply.com/networked-artifacts/air-lab\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.crowdsupply.com/networked-artifacts/air-lab\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe started building the Air Lab because most air quality measuring devices we found were locked-down or hard to tinker with. Air quality is a growing concern, and we’re hoping a more open, playful approach can help make the topic more accessible. It is important to us that there is a low bar for customizing and extending the Air Lab. Until we ship, we plan to create rich documentation and further tools, like the simulator, to make this as easy as possible.\u003cp\u003eThe technical: The device is powered by the popular ESP32S3 microcontroller, equipped with a precise CO2, temperature, and relative humidity sensor (SCD41) as well as a VOC/NOx (SGP41) and atmospheric pressure sensor (LPS22). The support circuitry provides built-in battery charging, a real-time clock, an RGB LED, buzzer, an accelerometer, and capacitive touch, which makes Air Lab a powerful stand-alone device. The firmware itself is written on top of esp-idf and uses LVGL for rendering the UI.\u003cp\u003eIf you seek more high-level info, here are also some videos covering the project:\n- \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBltdMLjUyg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBltdMLjUyg\u003c/a\u003e (Introduction)\n- \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tzjVYPm_MU\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tzjVYPm_MU\u003c/a\u003e (Product Update)\u003cp\u003eWould love your feedback — on the device, hardware choices, potential use cases, or anything else worth improving.
