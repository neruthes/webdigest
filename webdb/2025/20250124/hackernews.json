I'm one of the lead devs of this project at fal.ai and we created an open source lightweight video editor powered by the latest media AI models. The main goal was to tackle some challenges when dealing with complex media handling and encoding on the browser.\u003cp\u003eIt all started as an internal experiment but as we tackled some of the issues it was clear there could be some value sharing it with the open source community.\u003cp\u003eSome of the key points and tech stack details:\u003cp\u003e- It uses IndexedDb, so all data is local (i.e. no auth, no cloud db)\u003cp\u003e- Multiple AI models for video, image, music and voice-over. APIs are provided by fal.ai\u003cp\u003e- Built with the typical React+Next.js, Shadcn front-end\u003cp\u003e- Used remotion.dev for the realtime video preview (this is such a great project, without it the codebase would be twice as large)\u003cp\u003e- File uploads so you can bring your own media by uploadthing.com\u003cp\u003e- ffmpeg for encoding the final video and also some ui tricks, like the audio waveform\u003cp\u003eWe deployed a version of it and for now it's free to use. We do plan to add some rate limiting and a bring your own API Key next, but it's open source and I'm curious about what the community will build on top of it, or derive from it. Customize your own video app and if you do, please share.\u003cp\u003eIf you have any questions, hit me up!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42806616\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42806616\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 114\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 20\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://github.com/fal-ai-community/video-starter-kit","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42806616","date_published":"2025-01-23T18:34:38Z","author":{"name":"drochetti","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=drochetti"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42806486","title":"Building a Medieval Castle from Scratch","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://www.guedelon.fr/en/\"\u003ehttps://www.guedelon.fr/en/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42806486\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42806486\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 142\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 37\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.guedelon.fr/en/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42806486","date_published":"2025-01-23T18:24:30Z","author":{"name":"CharlesW","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=CharlesW"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42806328","title":"Llama.vim – Local LLM-assisted text completion","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.vim\"\u003ehttps://github.com/ggml-org/llama.vim\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42806328\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42806328\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 273\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 66\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.vim","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42806328","date_published":"2025-01-23T18:06:42Z","author":{"name":"kgwgk","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kgwgk"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42806301","title":"Introducing Operator","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/\"\u003ehttps://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42806301\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42806301\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 271\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 236\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42806301","date_published":"2025-01-23T18:03:40Z","author":{"name":"meetpateltech","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=meetpateltech"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42806247","title":"Thank HN: My bootstrapped startup got acquired today","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHello HN,\u003cp\u003eI'm Paras Chopra, founder of VWO.
