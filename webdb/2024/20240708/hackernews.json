But I was always frustrated that there wasn't a simple and elegant app that I could use with my Mac. I made do by wrapping JupyterLab in a chrome app, and then more recently switching to VS Code to make use of Copilot. I've always craved a more focused and lighter-weight experience when working in a notebook. That's why I created Satyrn.\u003cp\u003eIt starts up really fast (faster time-to-execution than VS Code or JupyterLab), you can launch notebooks right from the Finder, and the design is super minimalist. It's got an OpenAI integration (use your own API key) for multi-cell generation with your notebook as context (I'll add other LLMs soon). And many more useful features like a virtual environment management UI, Black code formatting, and easy image/table copy buttons.\u003cp\u003eFull disclosure: it's built with Electron. I originally wrote it in Swift but couldn't get the editor experience to where I wanted it. Now it supports autocomplete, multi-cursor editing, and moving the cursor between cells just like you'd expect from JupyterLab or VS Code.\u003cp\u003eSatyrn sits on top of the jupyter-server, so it works with all your existing python kernels, Jupyter configuration, and ipynb files. It only works with local files at the moment, but I'm planning to extend it to support remote servers as well.\u003cp\u003eI'm an indie developer, and I will try to monetize at some point, but it's free while in alpha. If you're interested, please try it out!\u003cp\u003eI'd love your feedback in the comments, or you can contact me at jack-at-satyrn-dot-app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40899242\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40899242\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 255\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 73\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://satyrn.app/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40899242","date_published":"2024-07-07T17:59:31Z","author":{"name":"jackhodkinson","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jackhodkinson"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40898654","title":"Zuckerberg and Peter Thiel on Facebook, Millenials, and Predictions for 2030","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://www.techemails.com/p/mark-zuckerberg-peter-thiel-millennials\"\u003ehttps://www.techemails.com/p/mark-zuckerberg-peter-thiel-millennials\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40898654\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40898654\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 101\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 116\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.techemails.com/p/mark-zuckerberg-peter-thiel-millennials","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40898654","date_published":"2024-07-07T16:28:34Z","author":{"name":"jbredeche","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jbredeche"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40897518","title":"Mongo but on Postgres and with strong consistency benefits","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/event-driven-io/Pongo\"\u003ehttps://github.com/event-driven-io/Pongo\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40897518\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40897518\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 157\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 84\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://github.com/event-driven-io/Pongo","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40897518","date_published":"2024-07-07T13:22:12Z","author":{"name":"oskar_dudycz","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=oskar_dudycz"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40897506","title":"A reawakening of systems programming meetups","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://notes.eatonphil.com/2024-07-07-systems-meetups.html\"\u003ehttps://notes.eatonphil.com/2024-07-07-systems-meetups.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40897506\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40897506\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 218\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 84\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://notes.eatonphil.com/2024-07-07-systems-meetups.html","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40897506","date_published":"2024-07-07T13:20:37Z","author":{"name":"paulgb","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=paulgb"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40897205","title":"YouTube embeds are heavy and it’s fixable","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://frontendmasters.com/blog/youtube-embeds-are-bananas-heavy-and-its-fixable/\"\u003ehttps://frontendmasters.com/blog/youtube-embeds-are-bananas-heavy-and-its-fixable/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40897205\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40897205\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 283\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 166\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://frontendmasters.com/blog/youtube-embeds-are-bananas-heavy-and-its-fixable/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40897205","date_published":"2024-07-07T12:37:55Z","author":{"name":"surprisetalk","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=surprisetalk"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40896873","title":"Show HN: Execute JavaScript in a WebAssembly QuickJS sandbox","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eThis TypeScript package allows you to safely execute JavaScript code within a WebAssembly sandbox using the QuickJS engine.
