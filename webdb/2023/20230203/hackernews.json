HN: Suggestions for working effectively with junior devs?","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eI'm a senior dev at one of the FAANGs with more than 15 years of experience, but the rest of my team consists of devs with an average of 2 years of experience. At first when I joined, I thought this was an aberration, but there are many teams around me that are structured similarly. Is this how FAANGs try to scale teams? The devs on my team are smart but mostly naive about getting stuff done in the real world. I'm sure they'll figure it out over time. But in the meantime, my days are quite frustrating because I'm in teaching mode most of the time instead of building stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34628933\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34628933\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 132\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 109\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34628933","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34628933","date_published":"2023-02-02T16:33:32Z","author":{"name":"tinglytoes","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tinglytoes"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34628889","title":"Carving the scheduler out of our orchestrator","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://fly.io/blog/carving-the-scheduler-out-of-our-orchestrator/\"\u003ehttps://fly.io/blog/carving-the-scheduler-out-of-our-orchestrator/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34628889\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34628889\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 168\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 33\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fly.io/blog/carving-the-scheduler-out-of-our-orchestrator/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34628889","date_published":"2023-02-02T16:30:28Z","author":{"name":"darthShadow","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=darthShadow"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34628386","title":"Play Counter Strike 1.6, with full multiplayer, in the browser","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://play-cs.com/en/servers\"\u003ehttps://play-cs.com/en/servers\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34628386\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34628386\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 848\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 339\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://play-cs.com/en/servers","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34628386","date_published":"2023-02-02T16:00:15Z","author":{"name":"philosopher1234","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=philosopher1234"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34627780","title":"Chat GPT is the birth of the real Web 3.0, and it's not going to be fun","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://lajili.com/posts/post-2/\"\u003ehttps://lajili.com/posts/post-2/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34627780\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34627780\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 337\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 331\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://lajili.com/posts/post-2/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34627780","date_published":"2023-02-02T15:25:26Z","author":{"name":"iraldir","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=iraldir"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34627754","title":"Exploring Rust for Vulkan drivers, part 1","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/blog/2023/02/02/exploring-rust-for-vulkan-drivers-part-1/\"\u003ehttps://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/blog/2023/02/02/exploring-rust-for-vulkan-drivers-part-1/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34627754\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34627754\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 131\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 12\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/blog/2023/02/02/exploring-rust-for-vulkan-drivers-part-1/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34627754","date_published":"2023-02-02T15:24:21Z","author":{"name":"mfilion","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mfilion"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34627712","title":"Ask HN: How are you handling Section 174 changes for bootstrapped companies?","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHey everyone,\u003cp\u003eWas just starting the tax process for 2022 and found out about the changes that have been made to Section 174 that take effect this year. Essentially, all R\u0026E expenses must now be amortized over 5 years (instead of taking them as a regular full deduction in the year in which they are incurred), and on top of that all \"software development\" is now an R\u0026E expense. [1][2]\u003cp\u003eThis seems like a disaster for any bootstrapped software company. As an example, if you make $100k in income, and spend $90k making the software, at first glance you've got a successful company bringing in a 10% profit margin. Previously, you would have just paid tax on that $10k in profit. Makes sense.\u003cp\u003eUnder these new rules, the US actually says \"that $90k you spent to make the software has to be spread over 5 years, and you can actually only take 10% of it in the first year.\" Suddenly you've gone from a profit of $10k to a \"profit\" of $91k for tax purposes. Even at a 30% tax rate (which isn't even close to the top rate in the US), you're staring down a $27k tax bill that you're somehow supposed to pay out of the $10k in actual cash you have left on hand.\u003cp\u003eTo be clear, you will eventually get the taxes you pay back over the next 5 years. But how are bootstrapped companies without access to large capital reserves or investment supposed to come up with the money to pay these tax bills while they wait it out? For every dollar you spend on making software, you've now got to have 30+ cents in reserve just to pay the tax bill for the year!\u003cp\u003eI am completely flabbergasted as to how this was thought to be a good idea...it seems like it drastically increases the cost of starting a bootstrapped software company in the US, which is just terrible policy in general.\u003cp\u003eWas just curious -- is this interpretation what others are hearing from their own tax professionals? Is it affecting others and if so how are you dealing with it?\u003cp\u003e[1]
