We’re Kevin and Sohrab from Hestus (\u003ca href=\"https://www.hestus.co\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.hestus.co\u003c/a\u003e). We're working on an AI copilot for CAD. Today we're releasing a simple sketch helper for Fusion 360 and would love your feedback. Here’s a quick demo: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9n_eY-fM_E\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9n_eY-fM_E\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cp\u003eWhy we’re doing this: Mechanical engineers excel at generating initial design concepts but get bogged down translating ideas into final designs due to tedious, repetitive tasks. Our goal is to automate these mundane processes, allowing engineers to focus on the creative aspects of design.\u003cp\u003eHaving worked at multiple hardware companies—from medical devices to space launch vehicles—we know how often “trivial” components such as manufacturing rigging, get brushed under the table in scheduling conversations.  These tasks aren’t necessarily complex, but they take time and still require the rigor of production components.  From finding the perfect fastener to making sure mounting holes align, we aim to simplify and accelerate the design process from the complex to the mundane.\u003cp\u003eWe're tackling this problem similarly to how coding copilots help programmers work faster. Initially, rudimentary coding assistants offered simple suggestions like auto-completing variables. Now, they understand complex tasks, write entire code blocks, and help fix bugs. We're taking this step-by-step approach, starting with a beta that focuses on sketching.\u003cp\u003eOur sketch helper offers design suggestions, such as applying equality constraints to similarly sized circles or adding tangent constraints between lines and curves. While designers can do these tasks manually, they often require dozens of precise mouse clicks. Our software makes suggestions that you can preview and accept to streamline your workflow. Over time we aim to improve at anticipating your needs and expand beyond sketching to other design aspects like resolving interference issues, auto-generating bills of materials with purchase links, and offering manufacturability suggestions.\u003cp\u003eHow this is different from other solutions: we've heard of complete generative part design solutions, but we don't believe this top down approach is the best way to assist mechanical engineers. Engineers excel at and enjoy designing new concepts—we want to focus on streamlining the most tedious aspects. Crucially, we find that generative solutions often overlook manufacturability, a key aspect of design.\u003cp\u003eWe invite you to try our sketch helper and share your thoughts! If you can think of any additional features that would make it more useful to you, we’d love to hear what they are.

We're Ben and Izak, founders of Repaint (YC S23). Repaint is like Figma, but for creating real websites.\u003cp\u003eIt has panning, zooming, and dragging elements around. The settings closely follow html/css. We think an open canvas is a big improvement over other website builders. Everything is easier: styling, consistency, responsiveness…\u003cp\u003eBut making it work was hard! We thought HN would appreciate the tech behind it:\n- A custom WebGL rendering engine (w/text, shadows, blurs, gradients, \u0026 opacity groups)\n- A partial implementation of the css spec\n- A custom text editor \u0026 text shaper\n- A transformer to turn designs into publishable html/css\u003cp\u003eRepaint is a design tool for html/css. But internally, it doesn’t actually use html/css itself. All your designs live in a single \u003ccanvas\u003e element.\u003cp\u003eWe wanted users to be able to see all their content on one screen. We target +60fps, so frames only have 16ms to render. The browser’s layout engine couldn’t handle simple actions, like zooming, with many thousands of nodes on the screen. To fix that, we wrote a rendering engine in WebGL.\u003cp\u003eSince we use custom rendering, we had to create a lot of built-in browser behavior ourselves.\u003cp\u003eUsers modify a large dom-like data-structure in our editor. Each node in the document has a set of css-like styles. We created a layout engine that turns this document into a list of positions and sizes. We feed these values into the rendering engine. Our layout engine lets us display proper html layouts without using the browser's layout engine. We support both flex and block layouts. We already support multiple layout units and properties (px, %, mins, maxes, etc.).\u003cp\u003eWe also can’t use the browser’s built-in text editor, so we made one ourselves. We implemented all the common text editor features regarding selection and content editing (clicking, selection, hotkeys, inline styling, etc.). The state consists of content and selection. The inputs are keystrokes, clicks, and style changes. The updated state is used to render text, selection boxes, and the cursor.\u003cp\u003eWhen you publish a website, we turn our internal document into an html document. We've intentionally structured our document to feel similar to a dom tree. Each node has a 1:1 mapping with an html element. Nodes have a list of breakpoints which represent media-queries. We apply the styles by turning them into selectors. All of the html pages are saved and stored on our fileserver for hosting.\u003cp\u003eWe made a playground for HN, so you can try it yourself. Now that the tech works, we’d love feedback and ideas for improving the product experience.\u003cp\u003eAnd we’d love to meet more builders interested in the space. If that’s you, feel free to say hello in the comments! Or you can reach Ben from his website.\u003cp\u003ePlayground: \u003ca href=\"https://app.repaint.com/playground\"\u003ehttps://app.repaint.com/playground\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eDemo Vid: \u003ca
