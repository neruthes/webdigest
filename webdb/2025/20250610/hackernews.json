Now they have to be amortized over several years.\u003cp\u003eHN has had many discussions about this, including \u003ci\u003eThe time bomb in the tax code that's fueling mass tech layoffs\u003c/i\u003e - \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44180533\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44180533\u003c/a\u003e - (927 comments) a few days ago.

One of the people working on it is YC's Luther Lowe (\u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=itsluther\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=itsluther\u003c/a\u003e). Luther has been organizing YC alumni to urge lawmakers to support this reversal. I asked him if we could do that on Hacker News too. He said yes—hence this thread :)\u003cp\u003eIf you're a US taxpayer and if you agree that software dev expenses should be deductible like they used to be, please sign this letter to the relevant committee members: \u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1DkRGeef2e_tU2xf3TyEyd2JLlmZH8sGs6hhuVkokgpw/viewform?edit_requested=true\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1DkRGeef2e_tU2xf3TyEyd2JLlmZ...\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cp\u003e(If you're not a US person, please don't sign the letter, since lawmakers will only listen to feedback from taxpayers and we don't want to dilute the signal.)\u003cp\u003eI'm sure not everyone here agrees with us—HN is a big community, there's no total agreement on anything—but this issue has as close to a community consensus as HN gets, so I think it makes sense to add our voices too.\u003cp\u003eLuther will be around to answer questions and hopefully HN can contribute to getting this done!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44226145\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44226145\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 1332\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 521\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44226145","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44226145","date_published":"2025-06-09T16:28:51Z","author":{"name":"dang","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dang"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44225352","title":"Show HN: Most users won't report bugs unless you make it stupidly easy","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eMost feedback tools are built like people actually want to report bugs. They don’t. Unless you make it dead-simple, or better yet - a little fun.\u003cp\u003eAfter shipping a few SaaS products, I noticed a pattern: Bugs? Yes. Bug reports? No.\u003cp\u003eNot because users didn’t care but because reporting bugs is usually a terrible experience.\u003cp\u003eMost tools want users to:\u003cp\u003e* Fill out a long form\u003cp\u003e* Enter their email\u003cp\u003e* Describe a bug they barely understand\u003cp\u003e* Maybe sign in or create an account\u003cp\u003e* Then maybe submit it\u003cp\u003eLet’s be real: no one’s doing that. Especially not someone just trying to use your product.\u003cp\u003eSo I built Bugdrop.app - It’s a little draggable bug icon that users can drop right on the issue, type a quick note, and they’re done. No logins. No forms. Just context-rich feedback that your team can actually use — with screenshots, browser info, even console logs if they hit an error.\u003cp\u003eAnd weirdly? People actually use it. Even non-technical users click it just because \"the little bug looked fun.\"\u003cp\u003eI didn’t want to build another \"feedback suite\". I just wanted something lightweight, fast, and so stupidly simple that people actually report stuff. If you've ever had a user say “something’s broken” and then ghost you forever, you probably get where I’m coming from.\u003cp\u003eWhat I’m most proud of? People are actually using it. And their users? They’re actually reporting stuff. Even non-technical ones.\u003cp\u003eWould love to hear if you’ve faced similar problems, and if this feels like something that would’ve helped in your own projects.
