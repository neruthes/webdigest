HN: Shimmer – ADHD-adapted body doubling","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eI’m Chris, one of the co-founders of Shimmer. In 2022, following my ADHD diagnosis, I launched Shimmer (\u003ca href=\"https://shimmer.care\"\u003ehttps://shimmer.care\u003c/a\u003e), a 1:1 ADHD Coaching for adults (HN launch here: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33468611\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33468611\u003c/a\u003e ). One problem we discovered while running 1:1 coaching is that people weren’t able to actually follow through (in real life) on the ideas they came up with during their weekly sessions with their coach.\u003cp\u003eThere is a concept called body doubling that’s popular within the ADHD community—it’s basically getting things done in the presence of other people. The positive accountability is proven to work. However, our members told us they tried other body doubling solutions or attempted to organize it themselves in real life but none of the solutions stuck. So we reverse engineered productive moments our members described, paired with scientific backing of what motivates ADHD-ers, and designed an online body doubling experience for our coaching members that provides a safe but productive space for them to get things done between weekly sessions.\u003cp\u003eA few of the motivators we infused into the traditional body doubling experience were 1) newness/novelty — each session has a different guided experience in the break like breathwork or stretching, 2) urgency — there’s a large visible pomodoro timer on the top left that counts down from 25 min, 3) community — the shared space is ADHD-friendly, and has a mood check-in \u0026 sharing functionality built in so you don’t feel alone, 4) accountability — there’s a task list where each time you check something off, it notifies the group, and you can view others’ as well if they opt in. Here’s a video walking through the product experience: \u003ca href=\"https://www.tella.tv/video/shimmer-body-doubling-demo-8b1c\"\u003ehttps://www.tella.tv/video/shimmer-body-doubling-demo-8b1c\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur body doubling was created and iterated alongside thousands of people with ADHD on our coaching platform over 9+ months of building \u0026 iterating with them. We’re excited to unveil this experience. If you have ADHD (or executive functioning challenges), we’d love for you to check out coaching \u0026 body doubling and give us critical feedback.\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eShimmer’s pricing: $140/mo. for Essentials plan (15-min weekly sessions), $230/mo. for Standard plan (30-min weekly sessions), $345/mo. for Immersive plan (45-min weekly sessions); all plans start with an additional 25% off the first month, HSA/FSA-eligible. The reason why the price is so high is that this is not a self-guided app or SaaS tool. You’re matched with a real, credentialed coach (not AI) and since ADHD coaching is not reimbursed in the US, the price is hard for us to bring down because the largest cost component is the coach’s compensation.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e*We know these prices are still expensive for many people with ADHD. Here are the actions we’re taking: (1) we offer needs-based scholarships and aim to have 5% of members on them at any time, (2) we often run fully sponsored scholarships with our partners—over 60 full ride scholarships and 100 group coaching spots have been disbursed alongside Asian Mental Health Project, Government of Canada, and more, and (3) we have aligned our coaching model alongside Health \u0026 Wellness Coaching, which is expected to be reimbursed in the next years. If there are ways we can further drive down the cost, please reach out to me directly at chris@shimmer.care.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42009087\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42009087\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 106\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 103\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.tella.tv/video/cm2xgdn2m000803l48ovf8b1c/view","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42009087","date_published":"2024-10-31T17:27:31Z","author":{"name":"christalwang","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=christalwang"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42008826","title":"Ford to Halt F-150 Lightning Production as EV Demand Wanes","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-31/ford-to-halt-f-150-lightning-production-as-ev-demand-wanes\"\u003ehttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-31/ford-to-halt-f-150-lightning-production-as-ev-demand-wanes\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42008826\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42008826\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 41\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 114\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-31/ford-to-halt-f-150-lightning-production-as-ev-demand-wanes","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42008826","date_published":"2024-10-31T17:05:32Z","author":{"name":"melling","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=melling"}}]}
