About 5 months ago, I left my job because I was completely burnt out. After taking some time off, I started freelancing. But I found tracking my time to be a real hassle as I kept forgetting to start or stop the timer and often had no idea what I’d worked on.\u003cp\u003eSo, I decided to build Taim as a side project, while also working now on some freelancing gigs. Taim is going to be automated time tracking tool for freelancers and teams. It’s designed to make tracking time effortless and accurate, so you can focus on your work and not worry about the clock.\u003cp\u003eI’m excited to share this with you all and would love your feedback!

HN: Struggling with poor memory and executive function. What to do?","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eIn my late 30s and have always struggled to effectively build a career, network, life. Has only occurred to me that this may due to what seems to be a deficiency in my memory. I've had a wealth of experiences, both good and bad, but few have found their way into my mental models of how the world works, and so I keep making the same mistakes or am unable to effectively navigate my way to a specific goal.\u003cp\u003eFrom learning new topics \u0026 skills, to learning how to network, to learning the dynamics of how an organization and how to navigate various relationships, to making well-reasoned and effective decisions, my mind often feels like mush, totally blinded to the realities of the world. I feel I've been stuck both cognitively and emotionally at a late-teen stage. Poor emotional regulation, difficulties with thinking in nuanced details, constantly flying at 1000 feet.\u003cp\u003eThe older I get with no improvement, the more it feels my goals keep drifting farther away. I want to get fit, I want to read more, I want to develop skills, I want to build relationships, I want to be an entrepreneur. These are things many of my colleagues have been working towards for years. It feels like I just wasn't given the playbook, and worse, am incapable of piecing one together.\u003cp\u003eHave any of you dealt with this?

During the day, I work for a California-based startup, and in the evenings, I enjoy working on side projects[1][2].\u003cp\u003eFor the past 3 years, I've been building and iterating on a product I called Horizon Pics, which is a file hosting service, similar to mainstream services, like Imgur. Horizon allows you to quickly upload and store all types of files, from images and video, to PDFs and other documents. The biggest differentiating factor is that Horizon's incentives are much more aligned with you, the end-user.\u003cp\u003eUnlike Imgur, Horizon has absolutely no ads, doesn't sell your data, has built-in security and privacy controls, and is fully focused on your file sharing needs. No social media or other bloat.\u003cp\u003eThis past week, I've launched a rebrand of Horizon which features a brand-new desktop app called Alpine[3], which serves as a local companion to Horizon. With it comes the capability to auto-upload screen captures and upload your clipboards as shareable pastes. For extra privacy, clipboard sharing can be automatically deleted after one view, or end-to-end encrypted with AES-256-GCM client-side. The desktop app is completely free to use! It's powered by Tauri using TypeScript, SvelteKit, Sass, and Rust.\u003cp\u003eHorizon offers a free plan with limited storage and upload sizes, while the paid plan offers higher limits.\u003cp\u003eLet me know what you think about the landing page[0].
