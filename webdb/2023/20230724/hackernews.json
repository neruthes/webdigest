HN: I made a MailChimp alternative that connects to your database","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHi all! Excited to share cc.dev after months of work and refinement.\u003cp\u003eThe idea for this product came from trying to do email marketing for my side project, CubeDesk, a site where Rubik's Cube enthusiasts can time themselves, race with one another, train algorithms — it's a fun niche!\u003cp\u003eWith over 40k users, sending even a single campaign was becoming expensive with MailChimp. I knew AWS SES would be much cheaper, but it’s just an API with none of the other necessities you need for a robust email marketing platform.\u003cp\u003eBeyond cost, I was also frustrated with having to make sure my database was always in sync with MailChimp and the audience schema they enforced. If I wanted to email every user who had completed 10 solves, that would be a whole ordeal and eat up hours of my day.\u003cp\u003eSo, I started (and am now launching):\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://cc.dev\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"\u003ehttps://cc.dev\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003ecc.dev connects directly to your database and lets you write SQL queries to target your audience. It's backed by AWS SES, so the cost to send emails is significantly less than what you're used to seeing. Combined with a template builder, media management, and campaign monitoring, cc.dev is meant to be your final destination whenever you need to send marketing emails to your users.\u003cp\u003eWould love to hear your feedback on this! If you're interested in trying out cc.dev as your email marketing platform, shoot me an email and let's have a chat: kash at cc.dev\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca

HN: I made a customizable iOS browser for minimalists and myself","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHello HN!\u003cp\u003eSo early this year I decided to build an iOS browser offering a large range of customization options, to accommodate anyone’s usage and visual preferences. Been using it as my default browser for 6 months and not looking back.\u003cp\u003eOn first launch it looks and behaves a bit like Safari, but to give you an idea, here are the various ways I customized it on my phone.\u003cp\u003e- More screen real estate for the webpage, less for the toolbar.\u003cp\u003e- A compact toolbar containing only the buttons for actions I use the most: new tab, close tab, open tab list. Since I use them hundred times a day, I need them available with button taps instead of swipe gestures.\u003cp\u003e- A toolbar button layout adapted to my left-handedness.\u003cp\u003e- A toolbar that disappears on scroll to allow full-screen reading.\u003cp\u003e- The toolbar and address bar at the bottom, as they should be.\u003cp\u003e- A popup menu showing the full URL and the buttons I use less frequently: back/forward (already available as screen edge gestures), share, reload, settings, etc.\u003cp\u003e- Showing the page title in the toolbar.\u003cp\u003e- Read time estimation for each tab.\u003cp\u003e- Opening the keyboard automatically when I open a new tab.\u003cp\u003e- Sorting tabs by read time, so that I can decide what to read based on how much time and focus I have.\u003cp\u003e- Grouping tabs by domain.\u003cp\u003e- A flat, condensed tab list, without snapshots.\u003cp\u003e- A full-black toolbar in dark mode to read at night.\u003cp\u003eIt’s still early days but things like content blockers, reader mode, iPad support, and more should arrive soon enough.\u003cp\u003eAnd of course, no analytics/monitoring/telemetry, no account creation, no backend. It’s not open source, but you can also inspect the app’s web views with Safari developer tools to see what’s going on under the hood.\u003cp\u003eWould love to hear if the level of personalization my app provides resonates with like-minded people.\u003cp\u003eHave a great day!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca
