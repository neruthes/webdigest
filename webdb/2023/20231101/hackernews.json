You can now get high quality answers for technical questions in 10 seconds instead of 50.\u003cp\u003eThe current 7th-generation Phind Model is built on top of our open-source CodeLlama-34B fine-tunes that were the first models to beat GPT-4’s score on HumanEval and are still the best open source coding models overall by a wide margin: \u003ca href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/bigcode/bigcode-models-leaderboard\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"\u003ehttps://huggingface.co/spaces/bigcode/bigcode-models-leaderb...\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cp\u003eThis new model has been fine-tuned on an additional 70B+ tokens of high quality code and reasoning problems and exhibits a HumanEval score of 74.7%. However, we’ve found that HumanEval is a poor indicator of real-world helpfulness. After deploying previous iterations of the Phind Model on our service, we’ve collected detailed feedback and noticed that our model matches or exceeds GPT-4’s helpfulness most of the time on real-world questions. Many in our Discord community have begun using Phind exclusively with the Phind Model despite also having unlimited access to GPT-4.\u003cp\u003eOne of the Phind Model’s key advantages is that it's very fast. We’ve been able to achieve a 5x speedup over GPT-4 by running our model on H100s using the new TensorRT-LLM library from NVIDIA. We can achieve up to 100 tokens per second single-stream while GPT-4 runs around 20 tokens per second at best.\u003cp\u003eAnother key advantage of the Phind Model is context – it supports up to 16k tokens. We currently allow inputs of up to 12k tokens on the website and reserve the remaining 4k for web results.\u003cp\u003eThere are still some rough edges with the Phind Model and we’ll continue improving it constantly. One area where it still suffers is consistency — on certain challenging questions where it is capable of getting the right answer, the Phind Model might take more generations to get to the right answer than GPT-4.\u003cp\u003eWe’d love to hear your feedback.\u003cp\u003eCheers,\u003cp\u003eThe Phind Team\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38088538\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38088538\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 532\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 235\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.phind.com/phindmodelhn","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38088538","date_published":"2023-10-31T17:40:47Z","author":{"name":"rushingcreek","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rushingcreek"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38087573","title":"Firefox got faster for real users in 2023","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2023/10/down-and-to-the-right-firefox-got-faster-for-real-users-in-2023/\"\u003ehttps://hacks.mozilla.org/2023/10/down-and-to-the-right-firefox-got-faster-for-real-users-in-2023/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38087573\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38087573\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 502\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 218\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2023/10/down-and-to-the-right-firefox-got-faster-for-real-users-in-2023/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38087573","date_published":"2023-10-31T16:39:13Z","author":{"name":"kevincox","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kevincox"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38087448","title":"Apple’s keynote event shot on iPhone and edited on Mac","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/behind-the-scenes-at-scary-fast-apples-keynote-event-shot-on-iphone/\"\u003ehttps://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/behind-the-scenes-at-scary-fast-apples-keynote-event-shot-on-iphone/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38087448\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38087448\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 165\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 133\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/behind-the-scenes-at-scary-fast-apples-keynote-event-shot-on-iphone/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38087448","date_published":"2023-10-31T16:32:37Z","author":{"name":"ayoreis","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ayoreis"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38086894","title":"Reverse-engineering Ethernet backoff on the Intel 82586 network chip's die","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"http://www.righto.com/2023/10/reverse-engineering-ethernet-backoff-on.html\"\u003ehttp://www.righto.com/2023/10/reverse-engineering-ethernet-backoff-on.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38086894\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38086894\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 139\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 23\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"http://www.righto.com/2023/10/reverse-engineering-ethernet-backoff-on.html","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38086894","date_published":"2023-10-31T15:59:57Z","author":{"name":"zdw","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zdw"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38086598","title":"Show HN: MicroTCP, a minimal TCP/IP stack","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/cozis/microtcp\"\u003ehttps://github.com/cozis/microtcp\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38086598\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38086598\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 106\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 32\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://github.com/cozis/microtcp","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38086598","date_published":"2023-10-31T15:43:12Z","author":{"name":"cozis","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=cozis"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38086387","title":"Show HN: Streamdal – an open-source tail -f for your data","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHey there!

We call it \u003ci\u003e\"Streamdal\"\u003c/i\u003e which is a word salad for streaming systems (because we love them) and DAL or data access layer (because we’re nerds).\u003cp\u003eHere's the repo: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/streamdal/streamdal\"\u003ehttps://github.com/streamdal/streamdal\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere's the site: \u003ca href=\"https://streamdal.com\"\u003ehttps://streamdal.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd here's a live demo: \u003ca href=\"https://demo.streamdal.com\"\u003ehttps://demo.streamdal.com\u003c/a\u003e (github repo has an explanation of the demo)\u003cp\u003e— — —\u003cp\u003eTHE PROBLEM\u003cp\u003eWe built this because the current observability tooling is not able to provide real-time insight into the actual data that your software is reading or writing. Meaning that it takes longer to identify issues and longer to resolve them. That’s time, money, and customer satisfaction at stake.\u003cp\u003eWant to build something in-house? Prepare to deploy a team, spend months of development time, and tons of money bringing it to production.

What we mean is this:\u003cp\u003e1. We give you an SDK for your language, a server, and a UI.\u003cp\u003e2. You instrument your code with \u003ci\u003e`StreamdalSDK.Process(yourData)`\u003c/i\u003e anytime you read or write data in your app.\u003cp\u003e3. You deploy your app/service.\u003cp\u003e4. Go to the provided UI (or run the CLI app) and be able to peek into what your app is reading or writing, like with \u003ci\u003e`tail -f`\u003c/i\u003e.\u003cp\u003eAnd that's basically it. There's a bunch more functionality in the project but we find this to be the most immediately useful part. Every developer we've shown this to has said \"I wish I had this at my gig at $company\" - and we feel exactly the same. We are devs and this is what we’ve always  wanted, hundreds of times - a way to just quickly look at the data our software is producing in real-time, without having to jump through any hoops.\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eIf you want to learn more about the \"why\" and the origin of this project - you can read about it here: \u003ca href=\"https://streamdal.com/manifesto\"\u003ehttps://streamdal.com/manifesto\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cp\u003e— — —\u003cp\u003eHOW DOES IT WORK?\u003cp\u003eThe SDK establishes a long-running session with the server (using gRPC) and \"listens\" for commands that are forwarded to it all the way from the \u003ci\u003eUI -\u003e server -\u003e SDK\u003c/i\u003e.\u003cp\u003eThe commands are things like: \u003ci\u003e\"show me the data that you are currently consuming\"\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003e\"apply these rules to all data that you produce\"\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003e\"inspect the schema for all data\"\u003c/i\u003e, and so on.\u003cp\u003eThe SDK interprets the command and either executes Wasm-based rules against the data it's processing or if it's a \u003ci\u003e`tail`\u003c/i\u003e request - it'll send the data to the server, which will forward it to the UI for display.\u003cp\u003eThe SDK \u003ci\u003eIS\u003c/i\u003e part of the critical path but it does not have a dependency on the server. If the server is gone, you won't be able to use the UI or send commands to the SDKs, but that's about it - the SDKs will continue to work and attempt to reconnect to the server behind the scenes.\u003cp\u003e— — —\u003cp\u003eTECHNICAL BITS\u003cp\u003eThe project consists of a lot of \"buzzwordy\" tech: we use gRPC, grpc-Web, protobuf, redis, Wasm, Deno, ReactFlow, and probably a few other things.\u003cp\u003eThe server is written in Go, all of the Wasm is Rust and the UI is Typescript.

HN: Light implementation of Event Sourcing using PostgreSQL as event store","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHi everyone,\u003cp\u003eIf you have a Java Spring Boot application with a PostgreSQL database, you can implement Event Sourcing without introducing new specialized databases or frameworks.\u003cp\u003eIf you have an application dealing with an entity called Order, you should adopt Event Sourcing to keep track of all changes, and know how the Order got into the current state.\u003cp\u003eEvent Sourcing gives you:\u003cp\u003e1. the true history of the system (audit and traceability),\u003cp\u003e2. the ability to put the system in any prior state (debugging),\u003cp\u003e3. the ability to create read projections from events as needed to respond to new demands.\u003cp\u003eThere are several well-known specialized frameworks and databases for Event Sourcing: EventStoreDB, Marten, Eventuate, to name a few.\nBut adopting a new framework or database you are not familiar with may stop you from trying the Event Sourcing pattern in your project. But you can actually implement Event Sourcing with a few classes and use PostgreSQL as an event store.\u003cp\u003eThe \"postgresql-event-sourcing\" project is a reference implementation of an event-sourced system that uses PostgreSQL as an event store built with Spring Boot. Fork the repository and use it as a template for your projects. Or clone the repository and run end-to-end tests to see how everything works together.\u003cp\u003eThe project describes in detail:\u003cp\u003e- database model for storing events,\u003cp\u003e- synchronous and asynchronous event handlers,\u003cp\u003e- CQRS,\u003cp\u003e- Transactional Outbox pattern,\u003cp\u003e- Polling Publisher pattern,\u003cp\u003e- optimized publisher that uses PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY capabilities,\u003cp\u003e- and more.\u003cp\u003eThis project can be easily extended to comply with your domain model.\u003cp\u003eThe source code is available on GitHub \u003c\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing\"\u003ehttps://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing\u003c/a\u003e\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38084098\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38084098\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 167\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 36\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38084098","date_published":"2023-10-31T12:56:43Z","author":{"name":"eugene-khyst","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=eugene-khyst"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38083588","title":"AV1 video codec gains broader hardware support","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://fullystacked.net/posts/av1/\"\u003ehttps://fullystacked.net/posts/av1/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38083588\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38083588\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 296\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 176\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://fullystacked.net/posts/av1/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38083588","date_published":"2023-10-31T12:16:35Z","author":{"name":"llcooliovice","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=llcooliovice"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38083484","title":"I've overlayed stays on a light pollution satellite map","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://darkhotels.co\"\u003ehttps://darkhotels.co\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38083484\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38083484\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 426\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 175\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://darkhotels.co","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38083484","date_published":"2023-10-31T12:04:58Z","author":{"name":"louison11","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=louison11"}}]}
