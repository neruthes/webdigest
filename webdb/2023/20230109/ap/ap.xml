(AP) — Nyheim Hines ignited an emotionally charged atmosphere celebrating injured Bills safety Damar Hamlin by returning two kickoffs for touchdowns, and Buffalo clinched the AFC’s second playoff seed with a 35-23 win over the New England Patriots on Sunday.</p><p>The loss, coupled with Miami beating the New York Jets, eliminated the Patriots (8-9) from the playoffs for the second time in three years, and just the fourth time in 23 seasons during Bill Belichick’s coaching tenure. Buffalo will now host their division rival Dolphins in the wild-card round next weekend.</p><p>With the game in hand, Bills players held up three fingers in honor of Hamlin’s number with the crowd chanting “Hamlin! Hamlin!”</p><p>The Bills (13-3) closed their season by winning their final seven games and overcame an emotional week in which the team was left devastated in watching Hamlin collapse after going into cardiac arrest and having to be resuscitated on the field in Cincinnati on Monday night. </p><p>What followed was progressive good news of Hamlin’s remarkable recovery in which he was not only able to breathe on his own, but also managed to address his teammates while saying “Love you boys” on Friday.</p><p>And leave it to receiver Stefon Diggs, who made a point to visit Hamlin in the University of Cincinnati Medical Center immediately following the game, to seal the victory with a 49-yard touchdown catch from Josh Allen to put Buffalo ahead 35-23 with 8:51 remaining. </p><div id="afs:Card:234821764243" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="25243cdf2ceb3780419859fc39537ef4">Hub peek embed (NFL) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The sold-out crowd — many of them wearing No. 3 Hamlin shirts and jerseys, and holding up red hearts in the player’s honor — erupted as one as Allen walked off the field with his hands raised.</p><p>On the ensuing kickoff, which went for a touchback, the Bills special teams players all raced into the end zone and motioned to the crowd. The fans, as one, stood up and let out a massive roar.</p><p>Allen finished 19 of 31 for 254 yards with three touchdowns and an interception.</p><p>On a day the Bills celebrated No. 3, and with Hamlin watching and live-tweeting from his hospital bed in Cincinnati, two touchdowns by Hines proved key. </p><p>The crowd had barely settled into its seats following a pregame ceremony honoring Hamlin when Hines returned the opening kickoff 96 yards for a score.</p><p>His second put the Bills ahead for good, coming 13 seconds after Nick Folk hit a 24-yard field goal to put New England up 17-14 midway through the third quarter.</p><p>Acquired by Buffalo in a trade with Indianapolis two months ago, Hines became the NFL’s 11th player to return two kickoffs for scores in a game, and first since Seattle’s Leon Washington in 2010.</p><p>The Patriots needed only a win to clinch a playoff berth, but wound up stumbling in closing the season by losing five of their last seven. </p><p>Mac Jones finished 26 of 40 for 243 yards and three touchdowns, including two to DeVante Parker, and three interceptions — all coming in the second half. </p><p>Jones’ final two interceptions came on consecutive drives in the final six minutes.</p><p>Facing third-and-19 at the Buffalo 22, Jones' deep pass over the middle went off the hand of tight end Hunter Henry, and was picked off by linebacker Matt Milano. </p><p>On New England’s next possession, Jones’ pass went off the hands of Damien Harris, and into the hands of linebacker Tremaine Edmunds.</p><p>MILESTONE</p><p>Patriots defensive back Devin McCourty had an interception and recovered Devin Singletary’s fumble. The interception was the 35th of McCourty’s 13-year career, moving him one behind Ty Law and Raymond Clayborn, who are tied for first on the franchise list.</p><p>The 35-year-old McCourty made his 205th start for New England in what could be his final game for the franchise.</p><p>INJURIES</p><p>Patriots DT DaMarcus Mitchell did not return after sustaining a concussion.</p><p>UP NEXT</p><p>Patriots: Season over.</p><p>Bills: Host Miami Dolphins in AFC wild-card game.</p><p>___</p><p>AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL</p>]]></description>

Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as House Speaker on the House floor at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, early Saturday, Jan. 7, 2023. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — After <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-house-of-representatives-kevin-mccarthy-us-republican-party-0938c7358f41c83759246f8949ac7c15">an epic 15-ballot election</a> to become House speaker, Republican <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/kevin-mccarthy">Kevin McCarthy</a> faces his next big test in governing a fractious, slim majority: passing a rules package to govern the House.</p><p>The drafting and approval of a set of rules is normally a fairly routine legislative affair, but in these times, it's the next showdown for the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-house-of-representatives-kevin-mccarthy-government-e986c620149b72030bb418bd5fadb4a2">embattled McCarthy</a>.</p><p>To become speaker and win over skeptics, McCarthy had to make concessions to a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/congress-mccarthy-hard-right-foes-5edc1d9468e606a3f1230e98702d9a23">small group of hard-liners</a> who refused to support his ascension until he yielded to their demands.</p><p>Now those promises — or at least some of them — are being put into writing to be voted on when lawmakers return this week for their first votes as the majority party.</p><p>On Sunday, at least two moderate Republicans expressed their reservations about supporting the rules package, citing what they described as secret deals and the disproportionate power potentially being handed out to a group of 20 conservatives. </p><p>The concessions included limits on McCarthy's power, such as by allowing a single lawmaker to initiate a vote to remove him as speaker and curtailing government spending, which could include defense cuts. They also give the conservative Freedom Caucus more seats on the committee that decides which legislation reaches the House floor. </p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="4922d22689eb79d5d05c1b49ca733123">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>They also raise questions about whether McCarthy can garner enough support from Republicans, who hold a 222-212 edge, on a critical vote in the coming months to raise the debt limit, given conservatives' demand that there first be significant spending cuts, over opposition from the White House and a Democratic-controlled Senate.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., a strong McCarthy supporter, said she currently is “on the fence” about the proposed rules.</p><p>“I like the rules package,” Mace said, in reference to what has been released publicly. “What I don’t support is a small number of people trying to get a deal done or deals done for themselves in private, in secret.”</p><p>She said it will be hard to get anything done in the House if a small band is given a stronger hand compared with the larger number of moderates. “I am concerned that commonsense legislation will not get through to get a vote on the floor," she said.</p><p>Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, said was an outright “no” against the rules package, decrying an “insurgency caucus” that he said would cut defense spending and push extremist legislation, such as on immigration. </p><p>Democrats are expected to be united against the package.</p><p>Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a member of the Freedom Caucus who is expected to lead the House Judiciary Committee, defended the concessions McCarthy made and said he believes the rules package will get enough Republican support to pass. He insisted that the agreements will help ensure broader representation on committees and will curtail unfettered government spending. </p><p>“We'll see tomorrow,” he said, but “I think we’ll get the 218 votes needed to pass the rules package."</p><p>In the coming months, Congress will have to work to raise the debt limit before the government reaches its borrowing cap or face a devastating default on payments, including those for Social Security, military troops and federal benefits such as food assistance. Lawmakers will also have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-ukraine-government-us-republican-party-health-care-costs-13f3f7bfed22bda0cbf73002d9fec273">to fund federal agencies and programs</a> for the next budget year, which begins Oct. 1.</p><p>“Our general concern is that the dysfunction — that was historic — that we saw this week is not at an end, it’s just the beginning,” said <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nancy-pelosi-hakeem-jeffries-congress-government-and-politics-e6dee438b2cfd776b70ff29495072ab5">House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries</a> of New York.</p><p>The White House has rejected Republican calls to slash spending in return for an increase in the federal government’s borrowing authority. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre went so far on Sunday as to call House Republicans’ likely demands “hostage taking” that would risk default, an event that could trigger an economic crisis.</p><p>“Congress is going to need to raise the debt limit without — without — conditions and it’s just that simple,” Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-united-states-government-mexico-el-paso-2e30ea26bbc55c7af509a6e60ad3d33c?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=TopNews&amp;utm_campaign=position_02">President Joe Biden flew to Texas</a>. “Attempts to exploit the debt ceiling as leverage will not work. There will be no hostage taking.”</p><p>Yet the White House also said it had no plans to sidestep the needed congressional approval through possible budget gimmicks such as the minting of a coin to help cover a deficit that could be roughly $1 trillion this fiscal year.</p><p>“We’re not considering any measures that would go around Congress,” Jean-Pierre said. “That’s not what we’re doing. This is a fundamental congressional responsibility, and Congress must act.”</p><p>Jordan argued that “everything has to be on the table” when it comes to spending cuts, including in defense, in light of the government's $32 trillion debt. “Frankly we better look at the money we send to Ukraine as well and say, how can we best spend the money to protect America?” he said.</p><p>Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, one of the 20 who initially voted against McCarthy before throwing his support behind the Californian, said he and other conservatives will be holding their position that there should be spending cuts in a debt ceiling bill. Asked whether he would exercise members' new authority and unilaterally initiate a vote to remove the speaker if McCarthy doesn't ultimately agree, Roy offered a warning.</p><p> “I’m not going to play the ‘what if’ games on how we’re going to use the tools of the House to make sure that we enforce the terms of the agreement, but we will use the tools of the House to enforce the terms of the agreement,” Roy said.</p><p>Mace and Gonzales appeared on CBS' “Face the Nation,” Jordan spoke on “Fox News Sunday,” Jeffries was on NBC's “Meet the Press,” and Roy was on CNN's “State of the Union.”</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Josh Boak contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

Zwerner was shot Friday at Richneck Elementary School, authorities said.</p><p>Shortly after the shooting, police said Zwerner had life-threatening injuries, but she has improved and was listed in stable condition at a local hospital.</p><p>Eley and other city officials met with teachers and the principal at the school Friday and later went to the hospital, where they met with members of Zwerner's family, including several aunts who also are teachers.</p><p>“The family was all educators and said she was excited about doing the job,” said Eley, who was recently elected to the Newport News City Council.</p><p>“The custodians and other teachers spoke about how she's a good teammate, she's a team player, she loves her children, she's just an all-around good teacher.”</p><p>Cindy Hurst said her granddaughter, 8, is still rattled by the shooting.

He was later taken into police custody. Drew said the shooting was not accidental and was part of an altercation. No students were injured.</p><p>Police have declined to describe what led to the altercation or any other details about what happened in the classroom, citing the ongoing investigation. They have also declined to say how the boy got access to the gun or who owns the weapon.</p><p>Virginia law does not allow 6-year-olds to be tried as adults. In addition, a 6-year-old is too young to be committed to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice if found guilty.</p><p>A juvenile judge would have authority, though, to revoke a parent’s custody and place a child under the purview of the Department of Social Services.</p><p>Mayor Phillip Jones would not say where the boy is being held.</p><p>“We are ensuring he has all the services that he currently needs right now,” Jones said Saturday.</p><p>Experts who study gun violence said the shooting represents an extremely rare occurrence of a young child bringing a gun into school and wounding a teacher.</p><p>“It’s very rare and it’s not something the legal system is really designed or positioned to deal with,” said researcher David Riedman, founder of a database that tracks U.S. school shootings dating back to 1970.</p><p>He said Saturday that he’s only aware of three other shootings caused by 6-year-old students in the time period he’s studied. Those include the fatal shooting of a fellow student in 2000 in Michigan and shootings that injured other students in 2011 in Texas and 2021 in Mississippi.</p><p>Riedman said he only knows of one other instance of a student younger than that causing gunfire at a school, in which a 5-year-old student brought a gun to a Tennessee school in 2013 and accidentally discharged it. No one was injured in that case.</p><p>Newport News is a city of about 185,000 people in southeastern Virginia known for its shipyard, which builds the nation’s aircraft carriers and other U.S. Navy vessels.</p><p>Richneck has about 550 students in kindergarten through fifth grade, according to the Virginia Department of Education’s website. Jones said there will be no classes at the school Monday and Tuesday.</p>]]></description>

He was 54. </p><p>Rich died Saturday at his home in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles, said Lt. Aimee Earl of the Los Angeles County Medical-Examiner Coroner’s office. The cause of death was under investigation but was not considered to be suspicious. </p><p>Rich had a limited acting career after starring at age 8 as Nicholas Bradford, the youngest of eight children, on the ABC hit dramedy that ran from from 1977 to 1981. </p><p>He had several run-ins with police related to drugs and alcohol — and sought treatment at the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage.</p><p>Rich suffered from a type of depression that defied treatment and he had tried to erase the stigma of talking about mental illness, said publicist Danny Deraney. He unsuccessfully tried experimental cures over the years.</p><p>Deraney said he and others close to Rich were worried in recent weeks when they couldn’t reach him.</p><p>“He was just a very kind, generous, loving soul,” Deraney told The Associated Press. “Being a famous actor is not necessarily what he wanted to be. ... He had no ego, not an ounce of it.”</p><div id="afs:Card:958899307023" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="7294e6bf8061f6c12604c2716d34b722">Hub peek embed (apf-entertainment) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Rich discussed his mental health on Twitter and noted in October that he'd been sober for seven years. He said he wasn't perfect — referring to arrests, many stints in rehab, several overdoses and “countless detoxes (and) relapses" — and urged his nearly 19,000 followers to never give up. </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“Human beings weren’t built to endure mental illness,” Rich tweeted in September. “The mere fact that some people consider those to be weak, or have a lack of will is totally laughable … because it’s the total opposite! It’s takes a very, very strong person … a warrior if you will … to battle such illnesses.”</p><p>Rich posted a picture of himself from his heyday with one-time child star Mickey Rooney.</p><p>“Everyone used to say to me, ‘You are the modern day Mickey Rooney,’” he tweeted. “But when Mickey Rooney told me that himself, it meant a helluva a lot more to me!”</p><p>Nearly 27 years ago, Rich participated in a hoax that Might magazine published about the actor getting killed in a robbery outside a Los Angeles nightclub in 1996. The article in the little-known magazine was intended as a satire of America's celebrity obsession but fizzled when the spoof was revealed.</p><p>“I think we were a little too subtle. People were not getting the joke," Rich later told the Chicago Tribune. "I don’t want to be dead.” </p><p>Rich was the little brother to a generation of TV viewers as the mop-top son of a newspaper columnist played by Dick Van Patten, who has to raise eight children alone after his wife in the show — and the actress who played her — died during filming of the first season. </p><p>Rich starred in the series “Code Red” from 1981-82 and voiced the character of Presto the Magician on “Dungeons &amp; Dragons” from 1983-85, according to the IMDB.com. He reprised his best-known role in two “Eight is Enough” TV movie reunions. </p><p>But the balance of his acting career was in single-episode appearances on some of the most popular TV shows of the time: “The Love Boat,” “The Six Million Dollar Man,” “Silver Spoons,” and “Baywatch.” His most recent credit listed on IMDB was playing Crocodile Dundee on “Reel Comedy” in 2003.</p>]]></description>

They sprayed fire hoses inside the Congress building and ransacked offices at the presidential palace. Windows were broken in all of the buildings.</p><div id="afs:Card:272901778982" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="0c03c098a5e2a09ac534412c30ae8355">Hub peek embed (JairBolsonaro) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Bolsonaro, who <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-politics-brazil-miami-brasilia-bafec313b9fef5f7ab8717b524bd65de">flew to Florida ahead of Lula’s inauguration</a>, has not commented on Sunday's events.</p><p>Police fired tear gas to try to regain control of the buildings. About 6:30 p.m. local time (4:30 p.m. EST), less than four hours after the storming, security forces were shown on television backing protesters away from the Supreme Court and marching them down a ramp to the presidential palace with their hands secured behind their backs.</p><p>But with the damage already done, many in Brazil were questioning how the police had ignored abundant warnings, were unprepared or were somehow complicit.</p><p>Lula said at his news conference there was “incompetence or bad faith″ on the part of police, and that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-caribbean-brazil-brasilia-government-fa08598a3abecb1e0e1e621199c0861b">they had been likewise complacent when Bolsonaro supporters rioted in the capital weeks ago</a>. He promised those officers would be punished and expelled from the corps.</p><p>The incident recalled the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump. Political analysts have warned for months that a similar storming was a possibility in Brazil, given that Bolsonaro has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-caribbean-brazil-b7c872b541371ff2925fae793007af87">sown doubt about the reliability of the nation's electronic voting system</a><a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-caribbean-brazil-c03ec4f0e1d65fc81c02a2d90181cf48"></a> — without any evidence. The results were recognized as legitimate by politicians from across the spectrum, including some Bolsonaro allies, as well as dozens of foreign governments.</p><p>Unlike the 2021 attack in the U.S., it is likely that few officials were working in the Brazilian Congress and Supreme Court on a Sunday.</p><p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Twitter that Washington condemned the attacks, saying that “using violence to attack democratic institutions is always unacceptable.”</p><p>Earlier videos on social media showed a limited presence of the capital's military police; one showed officers standing by as people flooded into Congress, with one using his phone to record images. The capital's security secretariat didn't respond to a request from The Associated Press for comment about the relative absence of the police.</p><p>“Brazilian authorities had two years to learn the lessons from the Capitol invasion and to prepare themselves for something similar in Brazil," said Maurício Santoro, political science professor at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. “Local security forces in Brasilia failed in a systematic way to prevent and to respond to extremist actions in the city. And the new federal authorities, such as the ministers of justice and of defense, were not able to act in a decisive way.”</p><p>Federal District Gov. Ibaneis Rocha confirmed on Twitter he had fired the capital city's head of public security, Anderson Torres. Local media reported that Torres is currently in the U.S.</p><p>The office of Lula’s attorney general asked the Supreme Court to order Torres’ imprisonment.</p><p>Bolsonaro supporters have been protesting Lula's electoral win since Oct. 30, blocking roads, setting vehicles on fire and gathering outside military buildings, urging the armed forces to intervene. The head of Brazil’s electoral authority rejected the request from Bolsonaro and his political party to nullify ballots cast on most electronic voting machines.</p><p>“Two years since Jan. 6, Trump’s legacy continues to poison our hemisphere,” U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez, who chairs the Senate’s foreign relations committee, tweeted, adding that he blamed Bolsonaro for inciting the acts. “Protecting democracy &amp; holding malign actors to account is essential.”</p>]]></description>

(AP) — The Buffalo Bills and their fans planned several tributes to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/buffalo-bills-nfl-sports-health-damar-hamlin-28a376ee8c719bf344eac27ab689046c">safety Damar Hamlin</a> for the team's game Sunday — No. 3 jerseys, homemade T-shirts and even a <a href="https://twitter.com/AP_NFL/status/1612143213128843264">10-foot wide get-well card</a>.</p><p>There was no scripting what happened once the Bills actually returned to action.</p><p>On their first play since a terrifying scene Monday, when Hamlin went into cardiac arrest during a game in Cincinnati, Bills return man Nyheim Hines ran the opening kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown against the New England Patriots. </p><p>The emotional, uplifting score was an early highlight to a cathartic day in Buffalo. A <a href="https://apnews.com/article/buffalo-bills-chicago-bears-detroit-lions-cincinnati-bengals-sports-48092707c1e931283a149919882e41e9">weeklong outpouring</a> of support continued as the Bills returned to the field for the first time since Hamlin had to be resuscitated after making a tackle during the first quarter at Cincinnati. Hamlin has since made what doctors call a remarkable recovery.</p><p>Though still listed in critical condition at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center as of Saturday, Hamlin’s neurological function has been deemed excellent, and he is breathing fully on his own while also able to speak.</p><p>“OMFG!!!!!!!!!!!!!,” Hamlin <a href="https://twitter.com/HamlinIsland/status/1612148644949495810?s=20&amp;t=rgOE21UBqaEqZKo7buC0eQ">tweeted</a> after Hines' touchdown.

That included sign shop owner Ryan Magnuson, who designed a 4-by-10-foot canvas card, which he erected at the foot of the Bills stadium entrance for all to see — and sign.</p><p>“It’s been very positive. I’ve seen Bills fans, I’ve seen Patriots fans and people wearing other NFL jerseys coming up. I think this is bigger than a team thing at this point,” Magnuson said. “This is for Damar.”</p><p>Magnuson’s goal is to somehow get his oversized card sent to Hamlin.</p><p>Fans filled the front of the sign with well-wishes some three hours before kickoff, offering messages such as “Stay Strong” and “Love.” Some wore No. 3 jerseys, which is Hamlin's number.</p><p>“Watching it live, it was sad to see,” said Kyle Blaney, wearing a Patriots jersey. “But it’s good to see everyone coming together to support him, not just Bills fans."</p><p>An extended pregame ceremony began with the Bills medical and athletic training staff being introduced on the field to a roaring ovation. The Bills entered the stadium with numerous players carrying flags, which read “Pray for Damar 3.” Fans held cardboard cutouts of the No. 3 and red hearts.</p><p>Former Bills running back LeSean McCoy led the pregame charge by asking fans to hold up three fingers while chanting “Let's Go Buffalo!”</p><p>Hines added another return TD in the third quarter, this one a 101-yard burst for a 21-17 lead. There had only been four kickoffs returned for touchdowns across the NFL all season before Hines' pair. It's the <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshDubowAP/status/1612178867393028096?s=20&amp;t=YcfTAit-Ncwe9ae9u11ngw">11th time</a> one player has returned two kickoffs for touchdowns in the same game, and the first since Seattle’s Leon Washington did it against San Diego in 2010.</p><p>NFL fans everywhere have joined in supporting Hamlin this week, including many who contributed <a href="https://apnews.com/article/buffalo-bills-cincinnati-bengals-nfl-sports-damar-hamlin-cebe60255599d0ccdcfea0b924ab076e">over $8 million</a> to Hamlin's Chasing M's Foundation. Sunday brought a chance to pay tribute together during the last week of the NFL season.</p><p>The electronic signs ringing the parking lots of Highmark Stadium all carried the message “Love For Damar 3.” Some fans decorated their homes in Bills blue and red colors with various tributes to Hamlin.</p><p>Players from both teams came out onto the field for warmups wearing shirts honoring Hamlin. Many Patriots players wore black sweatshirts with the words “Love for Damar” printed on the front. Several Bills players wore T-shirts with Hamlin’s likeness on the front and back.</p><p>The NFL is paying tribute to the player during all Week 18 games, which began Saturday, including a pregame moment of support and painting Hamlin’s No. 3 on the 30-yard line. The Bills will also wear “3” jersey patches.</p><p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell was scheduled to attend the Bills game. Also on hand was New York Gov. Kathy Hochul. She wore Hamlin’s number on a Bills jacket and <a href="https://twitter.com/GovKathyHochul/status/1612161478706229250?s=20&amp;t=MpKwXkGAsSkjb4o4tQBprg">tweeted a picture</a> from the stadium in which she and several fans held up three fingers. The message said #LoveForDamar.</p><p>Hamlin was being celebrated by fans in Cincinnati, where the Bengals hosted Baltimore.</p><p>“It’s been so great that Damar is OK," said David Coning, outside the Bengals' Paycor Stadium. "We’ve seen pictures of him. He’s got a smile. He’s texted. So I think that’s a big relief for everyone. So hopefully we can kind of get back to normal.”</p><p>In the vast parking lots circling the the Bills stadium, numerous fans wore self-made shirts and jerseys honoring Hamlin.</p><p>Sue Sonner wore a former Bills quarterback EJ Manuel’s No. 3 jersey, in which her husband covered over the player’s name with Hamlin. </p><p>“It’s going to be very emotional. I’m taking some tissues with me for sure,” said Sonner, who is from Corning, New York, and attended the game in Cincinnati.</p><div class="social-embed" id="se2:0d7f8770-7820-11ed-b1d5-7d80e62a54eb"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">GAMETIME!!! <a href="https://twitter.com/BuffaloBills?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BuffaloBills</a> 💙 <a href="https://t.co/PQYClonUHb">pic.twitter.com/PQYClonUHb</a></p>— 𝐃𝐚𝐦𝐚𝐫 𝐇𝐚𝐦𝐥𝐢𝐧 (@HamlinIsland) <a href="https://twitter.com/HamlinIsland/status/1612146641527799809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2023</a></blockquote> <p class="social-caption"> </p></div><p>“We could see the scurry and the trauma and the panic and all of that.

He was 82.</p><p>Banks, a professor emeritus at Princeton University, died Saturday in upstate New York, his editor, Dan Halpern, told The Associated Press. Banks was being treated for cancer, Halpern said.</p><p>Joyce Carol Oates, a former Princeton colleague who referred to Banks on Twitter as a great American writer and “beloved friend of so many," said he died peacefully in his home. </p><p>“I loved Russell &amp; loved his tremendous talent &amp; magnanimous heart,” Oates wrote. “'Cloudsplitter'” (was) his masterpiece, but all his work is exceptional.”</p><p>Born in Newton, Massachusetts, and raised in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, Banks was a self-styled heir to such 19th century writers as Nathaniel Hawthorne and Walt Whitman, aspiring to high art and a deep grasp of the country’s spirit. He was a plumber’s son who wrote often about working class families — whether those who died trying to break out, caught up in a “kind of madness” that the past can be erased, or those like himself who got away and survived and asked “Why me, Lord?”</p><div id="afs:Card:958899307023" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="bcec4ba2e2ea96f08341a95555241dcb">Hub peek embed (apf-entertainment) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Banks lived part of the year in Florida, and for a time had a home in Jamaica, but he was essentially a man of the North, with an old Puritan’s sense of consequences. Snow fell often in his fiction, from the upstate New York community torn by a bus crash in “The Sweet Hereafter” to the desperate, divorced New Hampshire policeman undone by his paranoid fantasies in “Affliction.” </p><p>In Banks’ critical breakthrough “Continental Drift,” published in 1985, oil burner repairman Bob Dubois flees from his native New Hampshire and goes into business with his wealthy brother in Florida, only to learn his brother’s life was as hollow as his own. </p><p>“His brother’s strut and brag were empty from the start, and in a deep, barely conscious way, Bob knew that all along and forgave him his strut and brag simply because he knew they were empty. But he had never believed it would come to this, to nothing,” Banks wrote. </p><p>“Cloudsplitter” was his most ambitious novel, a 750-page narrative on John Brown and his improbable quest to rid the country of slavery. The story long precedes Banks’ lifetime, but the inspiration was literally close to home. Banks lived near Brown’s burial ground in North Elba, New York, and he would pass by often enough that Brown “became a kind of ghostly presence,” the author told the AP in 1998.</p><p>“Cloudsplitter” reads like a prequel to Banks’ contemporary works, a summoning of Hawthorne and other early influences. As remembered by son Owen Brown, John Brown was a haunted man of the Old World whose resolve to free the slaves and punish the enslavers made his face burn like a revivalist preacher’s.</p><p>“I was a boy; I was frightened by my father’s face,” Banks’ narrator explains. “I remember father looking straight into our eyes, burning us with his gaze, as he told us to hear him now. He had determined that he would henceforth put his sins of pride and vanity behind him. And he would go out from here and wage war on slavery. The time has come, he declared, and he wished to join the time in full cry.”</p><p>Banks was a Pulitzer finalist for “Cloudsplitter” in 1999 and had been one 13 years earlier for “Continental Drift.” His other honors included the Anisfeld-Book Award for “Cloudsplitter” and membership in the American Academy of Arts and Letters.</p><p>Two of his books were adapted into acclaimed film releases in the late 1990s: “The Sweet Hereafter,” directed by Atom Egoyan and starring Ian Holm, and director Paul Schrader’s “Affliction,” which brought James Coburn an Academy Award for best supporting actor.</p><p>More recent works by Banks included the story collection “A Permanent Member of the Family” and the 2021 novel “Foregone,” in which an American filmmaker who moved to Canada during the Vietnam War looks back on his impulsive youth — a background Banks understood from the inside.</p><p>His books often told of absent and otherwise failing fathers and Banks’ own father, Earl Banks, was an alcoholic whom the author says beat him as a child and left him with a permanently damaged left eye. Russell was meant for other worlds, smart enough to have the nickname “Teacher” in high school and become the first of his family to attend college, receiving a full scholarship from Colgate University.</p><p>He was an idealist in search of ideals, among countless young people of the 1960s to adopt Jack Kerouac’s “On the Road” as a kind of Bible. He dropped out of Colgate and drove South with dreams of joining Fidel Castro’s revolutionary army in Cuba, a quest which ended in St. Petersburg, Florida.</p><p>He was married twice by his early 20s (and eventually had four children), endured more than a few bar fights, wrote poetry bad enough that he later wished he had burned it, worked for a time with his father as a plumber back in New Hampshire and resumed his education at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p><p>He was in his mid-30s, and nearing the end of his second marriage, when he published his first story collection, “Searching for Survivors,” and first novel, “Family Life.” By the start of the 1990s, when he turned 50, he was an established author and had settled into a lasting marriage with his fourth wife, the poet Chase Twichell.</p><p>“Over the years, I think that I’ve been able to make my anger coherent to myself, and that’s allowed me to become more lucid as a human being, as a writer, as — I hope — a husband, father, and friend,” he told Ploughshares for an interview that appeared in the magazine’s Winter 1993-94 issue. “It’s very hard to be a decent human being if you’re controlled by anger that you can’t understand. When you begin to acquire that understanding, you begin to become useful to other people.”</p>]]></description>

I won’t fight against it,” the 28-year-old told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAQ4tDTh46A">U.S.-based outlet The News Movement</a>. “I’m hoping my government looks at me as someone young at the time and naive.”</p><p>It's a line she's repeated in various media interviews since fleeing from one of the extremist group's last enclaves in Syria in early 2019.</p><p>But four years earlier, at the height of the extremists' power, she had voiced enthusiastic support for them on social media and <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ellievhall/gone-girl-an-interview-with-an-american-in-isis">in an interview with BuzzFeed News</a>. IS then ruled a self-declared Islamic caliphate stretching across roughly a third of both Syria and Iraq. In posts sent from her Twitter account in 2015 she called on Americans to join the group and carry out attacks in the U.S., suggesting drive-by shootings or vehicle rammings targeting gatherings for national holidays.</p><div id="afs:Card:738076027554" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="dfb3cde1330e15b69a4c18552c837664">Hub peek embed (IslamicStategroup) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>In her interview with TNM, Muthana now says her phone was taken from her and that the tweets were sent by IS supporters.</p><p>Muthana was born in New Jersey to Yemeni immigrants and once had a U.S. passport. She was raised in a conservative Muslim household in Hoover, Alabama, just outside Birmingham. In 2014, she told her family she was going on a school trip but flew to Turkey and crossed into Syria instead, funding the travel with tuition checks that she had secretly cashed.</p><p>The Obama administration cancelled her citizenship in 2016, saying her father was an accredited Yemeni diplomat at the time she was born — a rare revocation of birthright citizenship. Her lawyers have disputed that move, arguing that the father's diplomatic accreditation ended before she was born.</p><p>The Trump administration maintained that she was not a citizen and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/f1e0816ed7a34d489818e487a4904430">barred her from returning</a>, even as it pressed European allies to repatriate their own detained nationals to reduce pressure on the detention camps.</p><p>U.S. courts have sided with the government on the question of Muthana's citizenship, and last January the Supreme Court <a href="https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-alabama-united-states-birmingham-islamic-state-group-5195dd68a8b6753bac474265c5d108f7">declined to consider her lawsuit seeking re-entry</a>.</p><p>That has left her and her son languishing in a detention camp in northern Syria housing thousands of widows of Islamic State fighters and their children.</p><p>Some 65,600 suspected Islamic State members and their families — both Syrians and foreign citizens — are held in camps and prisons in northeastern Syria run by U.S.-allied Kurdish groups, according to a Human Rights Watch report <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/12/15/syria-repatriations-lag-foreigners-alleged-isis-ties">released last month</a>. </p><p>Women accused of affiliation with IS and their minor children are largely housed in the al-Hol and Roj camps, under what the rights group described as “life threatening conditions.” The camp inmates include more than 37,400 foreigners, among them Europeans and North Americans. </p><p>Human Rights Watch and other monitors have cited dire living conditions in the camps, including inadequate food, water and medical care, as well as the physical and sexual abuse of inmates by guards and fellow detainees.</p><p>Kurdish-led authorities and activists have blamed IS sleeper cells for surging violence within the facilities, including the beheading of two Egyptian girls, aged 11 and 13, in al-Hol camp in November. Turkish airstrikes targeting the Kurdish groups launched that month also hit close to al-Hol. Camp officials alleged that the Turkish strikes were targeting security forces guarding the camp.</p><p>“None of the foreigners have been brought before a judicial authority … to determine the necessity and legality of their detention, making their captivity arbitrary and unlawful,” Human Rights Watch wrote. “Detention based solely on family ties amounts to collective punishment, a war crime.”</p><p>Calls to repatriate the detainees were largely ignored in the immediate aftermath of IS' bloody reign, which was marked by massacres, beheadings and other atrocities, many of which were broadcast to the world in graphic films circulated on social media.</p><p>But with the passage of time, the pace of repatriations has started to pick up. Human Rights Watch said some 3,100 foreigners — mostly women and children — have been sent home over the past year. Most were Iraqis, who comprise the majority of detainees, but citizens were also repatriated to Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Russia and the United Kingdom. </p><p>The U.S. has repatriated a total of 39 American nationals. It's unclear how many other Americans remain in the camps.</p><p>These days, Muthana portrays herself as a victim of the Islamic State.</p><p>Speaking with TNM, she describes how, after arriving in Syria in 2014, she was detained in a guest house reserved for unmarried women and children. “I’ve never seen that kind of filthiness in my life, like there was 100 women and twice as much kids, running around, too much noise, filthy beds," she said. </p><p>The only way to escape was to marry a fighter. She eventually married and remarried three times. Her first two husbands, including the father of her son, were killed in battle. She reportedly divorced her third husband.</p><p>The extremist group, which is also known as ISIS, no longer controls any territory in Syria or Iraq but continues to carry out sporadic attacks and has supporters in the camps themselves. Muthana says she still has to be careful about what she says because of fear of reprisal.</p><p>“Even here, right now, I can’t fully say everything I want to say. But once I do leave, I will. I will be an advocate against this,” she said. “I wish I can help the victims of ISIS in the West understand that someone like me is not part of it, that I as well am a victim of ISIS.”</p><p>Hassan Shibly, an attorney who has assisted Muthana’s family, said it is “absolutely clear that she was brainwashed and taken advantage of.” </p><p>He said her family wishes she could come back, pay her debt to society and then help others from "falling into the dark path that she was led down."</p><p>“She was absolutely misguided, and no one is denying that. But again, she was a teenager who was the victim of a very sophisticated recruitment operation that focuses on taking advantage of the young, the vulnerable, the disenfranchised,” he said. </p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/c078bf1d0a954a69a4a64b5320b77b46/3000.jpeg" alt="Attendees wear VR headsets while previewing the Caliverse Hyper-Realistic Metaverse experience at the Lotte booth during the CES tech show Friday, Jan. 6, 2023, in Las Vegas.

(AP Photo/John Locher)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>LAS VEGAS (AP) — Is the metaverse closer than we think?</p><p>It depends on who you ask at CES, where companies are showing off innovations that could <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-science-business-las-vegas-consumer-electronics-show-ddb35495abeb87e054a83ab0bed1ae7b">immerse us deeper into virtual reality</a>, otherwise known as VR. </p><p>The metaverse — essentially a buzzword for three-dimensional virtual communities where people can meet, work and play — was a key theme during the four-day tech gathering in Las Vegas that ends Sunday. </p><p>Taiwanese tech giant HTC unveiled a high-end VR headset that aims to compete with market leader Meta, and a slew of other companies and startups touted augmented reality glasses and sensory technologies that can help users feel — and even smell — in a virtual environment. </p><p>Among them, Vermont-based OVR Technology showcased a headset containing a cartridge with eight primary aromas that can be combined to create different scents. It's scheduled to be released later this year.</p><p>An earlier, business-focused version used primarily for marketing fragrances and beauty products is integrated into VR goggles and allows users to smell anything from a romantic bed of roses to a marshmallow roasting over a fire at a campsite. </p><p>The company says it aims to help consumers relax and is marketing the product, which comes with an app, as a sort of digital spa mixed with Instagram.</p><div id="afs:Card:710305756722" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="c9de16360932e6a1fa7c4dcc8f86832c">Hub peek embed (apf-technology) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“We are entering an era in which extended reality will drive commerce, entertainment, education, social connection, and wellbeing,” the company’s CEO and co-founder Aaron Wisniewski said in a statement. “The quality of these experiences will be measured by how immersive and emotionally engaging they are. Scent imbues them with an unmatched power.”</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>But more robust and immersive uses of scent — and its close cousin, taste — are still further away on the innovation spectrum. Experts say even VR technologies that are more accessible are in the early days of their development and too expensive for many consumers to purchase. </p><p>The numbers show there's waning interest. According to the research firm NPD Group, sales of VR headsets, which found popular use in gaming, declined by 2% last year, a sour note for companies betting big on more adoption.</p><p>Still, big companies like Microsoft and Meta are investing billions. And many others are joining the race to grab some market share in supporting technologies, including wearables that replicate touch. </p><p>Customers, though, aren't always impressed by what they find. Ozan Ozaskinli, a tech consultant who traveled more than 29 hours from Istanbul to attend CES, suited up with yellow gloves and a black vest to test out a so-called haptics product, which relays sensations through buzzes and vibrations and stimulates our sense of touch. </p><p>Ozaskinli was attempting to punch in a code on a keypad that allowed him to pull a lever and unlock a box containing a shiny gemstone. But the experience was mostly a letdown. </p><p>“I think that’s far from reality right now,” Ozaskinli said. “But if I was considering it to replace Zoom meetings, why not? At least you can feel something.”</p><p>Proponents say widespread adoption of virtual reality will ultimately benefit different parts of society by essentially unlocking the ability to be with anyone, anywhere at any time. Though it's too early to know what these technologies can do once they fully mature, companies looking to achieve the most immersive experiences for users are welcoming them with open arms. </p><p>Aurora Townsend, the chief marketing officer at Flare, a company slated to launch a VR dating app called Planet Theta next month, said her team is building its app to incorporate more sensations like touch once the technology becomes more widely available on the consumer market. </p><p>“Being able to feel the ground when you’re walking with your partner, or holding their hands while you’re doing that… subtle ways we engage people will change once haptic technology is fully immersive in VR,” Townsend said. </p><p>Still, it's unlikely that many of these products will become widely used in the next few years, even in gaming, said Matthew Ball, a metaverse expert. Instead, he said the pioneers of adoption are likely to be fields that have higher budgets and more precise needs, such as bomb units using haptics and virtual reality to help with their work and others in the medical field.</p><p>In 2021, Johns Hopkins neurosurgeons said they used augmented reality to perform spinal fusion surgery and remove a cancerous tumor from a patient’s spine. </p><p>And optical technology from Lumus, an Israeli company that makes AR glasses, is already being used by underwater welders, fighter pilots and surgeons who want to monitor a patient’s vital signs or MRI scans during a procedure without having to look up at several screens, said David Goldman, vice president of marketing for the company.</p><p>Meanwhile, Xander, a Boston-based startup which makes smart glasses that display real-time captions of in-person conversations for people with hearing loss, will launch a pilot program with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs next month to test out some of its technology, said Alex Westner, the company’s co-founder and CEO. He said the agency will allow veterans who have appointments for hearing loss or other audio issues to try out the glasses in some of their clinics. And if it goes well, the agency would likely become a customer, Westner said.</p><p>Elsewhere, big companies from Walmart to Nike have been launching different initiatives in virtual reality. But it's unclear how much they can benefit during the early stages of the technology. The consulting firm McKinsey says the metaverse could generate up to $5 trillion by 2030. But outside of gaming, much of today’s VR use remains somewhat of a marginal amusement, said Michael Kleeman, a tech strategist and visiting scholar at the University of California San Diego. </p><p>“When people are promoting this, what they have to answer is — where’s the value in this? Where’s the profit? Not what’s fun, what’s cute and what’s interesting.”</p><p>___</p><p>For more coverage of CES, visit: <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/technology">https://apnews.com/hub/technology</a></p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Ken Sweet)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) — Dressed in a canary blue suit on a warm December night, sweat dripping from his brow, Bishop Lawrence Rolle belts out the lyrics to his latest hit song for the hundreds of children and adults gathered to celebrate Christmas. </p><p>“FTX!,” he sings, bent over and shaking his head for emphasis. “The money is gone!” </p><p>“FTX!,” his backup singer and audience scream back. “The money have done gone!”</p><p>The cryptocurrency exchange FTX was supposed to be the crown jewel of the Bahamian government’s push to be the global destination for all things crypto, after years of having an economy overly reliant on tourism and banking. Instead, FTX is bankrupt and Bahamians are trying to figure out what’s next for their country and whether their national crypto experiment has failed. Regulators are trying to locate FTX's customers' missing money. </p><p>Meanwhile, charities like Rolle’s and dozens of contractors now out of work hope that another company will come along and bring new opportunities to the island nation, without the complications and embarrassment of an alleged billion-dollar fraud. </p><p>Rolle, a Pentecostal preacher known as the “singing bishop,” is a prominent figure in the Bahamas. For decades, he’s cooked and donated food to the poor and provided school lunches from his neighborhood kitchen at International Deliverance Praying Ministry in Over-The-Hill, one of the most impoverished parts of the capital of Nassau. Rolle and his staff feed roughly 2,500 people a week.</p><div id="afs:Card:573080295919" content-id="7de9ee0db46b532b3609a26572e31853" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (Cryptocurrency) - Compressed layout (automatic embed)</div><p>Rolle had been invited by Kirby Samuel, the principal of Mt. Carmel Preparatory Academy, to sing as part of the school’s Christmas celebration. His act consisted mostly of a half dozen Afro-Caribbean gospel songs, but one number stood out — his social media hit about the recent collapse of FTX.</p><p>Rolle’s ministry received $50,000 from FTX in early 2022, one of several donations FTX made to the Bahamian people when it relocated to the Caribbean island nation in 2021. It was money, he said, that was used to restore a food storage trailer and make additional food donations. Rolle said it cost upward of $10,000 a week to run his food donation program. </p><p>Asked about the failure of FTX, Rolle described it as a sad distraction from the many issues facing the country. Others are angry, particularly with <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-crypto-downfall-a2eaec231027dfd9f18426ff8982bbf8">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, the young founder of FTX. The Bahamas had a reputation, like some other Caribbean isles, as a destination for illicit and offshore finance. There was a belief that crypto would allow the island to diversify its economy, give Bahamians more financial opportunities and overall help provide the country a more prosperous future.</p><p>The country enacted the Digital Assets and Registered Exchanges Act in 2020, making the Bahamas one of the first countries to put together a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. The prime minister, Philip Davis, participated in the groundbreaking ceremony for FTX’s new $60 million headquarters in Nassau in April, along with Bankman-Fried.</p><p>“Their arrival was sort of the culmination of the work the Bahamians did to move in this direction,” said Stefen Deleveaux, president and CEO of the Caribbean Blockchain Association. </p><p>Several other crypto companies and startups are headquartered in the Bahamas, some of them at an incubator known as Crypto Isle, not far from downtown Nassau.</p><p>Deleveaux said he became interested in crypto as early as 2014, and mostly has been trying to focus his organizations’ efforts on the non-trading parts of crypto, like blockchain technology, financial inclusion and technological uses. He remains skeptical about cryptocurrency trading.</p><p>“It’s frustrating. Now when people think about crypto they are going to think of FTX,” Deleveaux said. “That’s going to make my own job much harder.”</p><p>In some ways, FTX was both ubiquitous and removed from the local community, Bahamians said. Its ads were everywhere, most notably at the Nassau Airport in the hall for tourist arrivals. But at the same time, FTX ran most of its operations from the secure luxury compound known as Albany, where residents like Tiger Woods and Justin Timberlake can be regularly spotted. Albany is located on the opposite side of New Providence, the most populated island in the Bahamas and the location of Nassau.</p><p>“You don’t casually wander into Albany,” Deleveaux said. </p><p>One bartender at the Margaritaville Resort, where FTX ran up an unpaid $55,000 tab, described a group of 10 to 15 mostly white FTX employees who would eat in the restaurant, faces buried in their laptops the entire time. While FTX did hire Bahamians or contracted with Bahamian businesses, it was almost entirely for logistics jobs like construction, janitor services or food catering. </p><p>Just as quickly as FTX became engrained in elite Bahamian circles did the whole thing unravel. FTX <a href="https://apnews.com/article/cryptocurrency-technology-business-financial-crisis-a729281a5ef02a03ab3fcd95e152c2a8">failed in spectacular fashion</a> in early November, going from solvent to bankrupt in less than a week. One food catering servicer said he had to let go most of his workers after FTX, his biggest contract, went bankrupt. </p><p>Bankman-Fried, 30, was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-bahamas-united-states-government-1de16cdf7e6956b401e998c34ad1fd11">arrested last month in the Bahamas</a>, and extradited to the U.S. to face <a href="https://apnews.com/article/cryptocurrency-technology-business-united-states-government-us-securities-and-exchange-commission-32d27016350e3e175c500eeefaf2aa4d">criminal charges</a> in what U.S. Attorney Damian Williams has called “one of the biggest frauds in American history.” The floppy-haired crypto entrepreneur has been <a href="https://apnews.com/article/manhattan-legal-proceedings-indictments-business-fraud-120cf18510ce329d759e2370f958a87c">released on bail</a> and is scheduled to go on trial in October. </p><p>Meanwhile, law enforcement and regulators in the U.S. and the Bahamas, as well as lawyers and FTX’s new management, are trying to determine how much of investors’ and customers’ money “is gone,” as Bishop Rolle repeats often in his song. Estimates of how much money was lost in the FTX collapse have varied significantly, since some assets are still being recovered, but one estimate puts the losses at around $8 billion to $10 billion. </p><div id="d93d768f5f1a49a684e5277dcad9449c" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>“Like the rest of the world, I’ve been glued to my television set since (FTX’s) collapse,” said Mt. Carmel’s principal Samuel, in an interview. </p><p>Other Bahamians, however, said the FTX collapse has diverted attention away from the ongoing issues facing the Caribbean country. </p><p>The Bahamian economy was sorely tested in the coronavirus pandemic. The country effectively banned outside visitors for nearly two years, and only started letting cruise ships dock at its popular dock about eight months ago. In Nassau, there is widespread evidence of the pandemic’s economic toll. The British Colonial hotel, best known for being the site of the James Bond movie “Never Say Never Again,” was boarded up and closed in February. Rooms once went for $400 a night there. </p><p>Despite miles of pristine beaches, beautiful resorts, and the richest economy of the Caribbean, the Bahamas remains a country riven by inequality. Taxi drivers spoke about the inability to get even a $6,000 loan to buy their own vehicle. Roughly one out of five Bahamians do not have a bank account, according to the country’s central bank.</p><p>Late last year, the Bahamian government had to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-caribbean-minimum-wage-business-puerto-rico-2b665e74a74826e11e206e3d73251f4b">impose price controls</a> on dozens of food staples in a desperate attempt to combat inflation. </p><p>FTX officials seemed to recognize food and hunger as an issue to tackle to develop goodwill with its new neighbors. Along with the $50,000 donation to Rolle’s ministry, FTX donated $250,000 to Hands for Hunger and poured $1.1 million into a new non-profit known as the Agricultural Development Committee, focused on building up the nation’s food security. The founder of the Committee, Phillip Smith, did not respond to several requests for comment on the donation. </p><p>As FTX filed for bankruptcy, there was speculation in Bahamian media about whether Rolle might have to return the $50,000 donation, which he said was spent in roughly a month after it was received. </p><p>“We pinched that money the best we could, buying flour, rice,” Rolle said. “There’s just too many hungry people.”</p><p>“It’s a difficult issue for the Bishop, but it’s one thing I think everyone in the country will agree: whatever they gave him, he did not spend it on himself,” Mt. Carmel’s Samuel said.</p><p>“I just wish there will be better companies than FTX,” Rolle said. “Many of our children got no parents, or we got parents who have two or four or five children, or kids have no father. We can barely afford to feed them. I pray to God that someone comes to donate even more.”</p>]]></description>

Ukrainian officials denied there were any casualties. </p><p>The Russian Defense Ministry said its missiles hit two temporary bases housing 1,300 Ukrainian troops in Kramatorsk, in the eastern Donetsk region, killing 600 of them. Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said the strikes were retaliation for Ukraine’s attack in Makiivka, in which at least 89 Russian soldiers died.</p><p>Serhii Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for Ukraine's forces in the east, told The Associated Press that Russian strikes on Kramatorsk damaged only civilian infrastructure, adding: “The armed forces of Ukraine weren’t affected.”</p><p>The Donetsk regional administration said seven Russian missiles hit Kramatorsk and two more hit Kostyantynivka, without causing any casualties. It said an educational institution, an industrial facility and garages were damaged in Kramatorsk, and an industrial zone was hit in Kostyantynivka.</p><p>Kramatorsk Mayor Oleksandr Honcharenko said two school buildings and eight apartment houses were hit overnight. Photos he posted showed no indication that it had been an attack on the scale claimed by the Russians or that anyone had been in the buildings when they were struck.</p><div id="afs:Card:521103274690" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="46a8599f1fa971b8c773af2745326540">Hub peek embed (Russia-Ukraine) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“The world saw again these days that Russia lies even when it draws attention to the situation at the front with its own statements,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. </p><p>“Russian shelling of Kherson with incendiary ammunition right after Christmas. The strikes on Kramatorsk and other cities of the Donbas — aimed right at civilian sites and right when Moscow was reporting the supposed ‘silence’ of its army.” </p><p>Russia had declared a 36-hour cease-fire timed to coincide with <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-moscow-religion-orthodox-church-9bea8791e5eda36a0b01cb3b6da86bd5">Orthodox Christmas celebrations</a> on Saturday. Ukraine denounced the pause as a ploy. </p><p>Russia said the attack on Kramatorsk was in retaliation for the Ukrainian rockets that destroyed a facility in Makiivka, also in the eastern Donetsk region, where Russian soldiers were gathered in the early hours of Jan. 1. It was one of the deadliest attacks on the Kremlin’s forces since <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine">the war</a> began more than 10 months ago.</p><p>Also on Sunday, the Ukrainian military claimed to have hit a residential hall of a medical university in Rubizhne, a town in the Russian-occupied eastern Luhansk region, killing 14 Russian soldiers housed there. The number of wounded was unknown, it said.</p><p>Elsewhere in the east, Donetsk Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said one person was killed in strikes on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kyiv-politics-russia-ukraine-war-1389e0bc90800ce033d344b0bc69bff9">Bakhmut</a>, and eight others were wounded. The battles for Bakhmut and the nearby town of Soledar remained among the bloodiest on the front, Zelenskyy said.</p><p>In the northeastern Kharkiv region, the town of Merefa was hit during the night, killing one person, and two other settlements in the region were shelled, Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said.</p><p>Russia and Ukraine exchanged prisoners Sunday, swapping 50 on each side, according to Konashenkov, the spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, and Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian president's office.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP’s coverage of the war at <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine">https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine</a></p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Matt Smith, file)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — As Republican infighting debilitates Washington, lawmakers at some U.S. statehouses have managed to launch sessions complicated by similar GOP partisan divides or razor-thin margins of party control with a host of creative — if yet untested — solutions.</p><p>The approaches differ by state: a delicate working agreement here, a bipartisan truce there. “The commonality is the standing on the edge of the precipice,” said David Niven, an associate professor of political science at the University of Cincinnati.</p><p>America's fiercely divided politics are not limited to national government, where Republicans won <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-house-control-79475a4fc11e4375cd0dded651b9eede">a threadbare majority</a> in the U.S. House in November and elected Rep. Kevin McCarthy as speaker early Saturday on the 15th ballot.</p><p>In the states, a combination of factors — including an influx of Republicans from the far right -- have contributed to an air of uncertainty in some places as state legislatures begin business. The nation's shifting political sands left parties in some state legislative chambers with such small majorities that each unexpected departure or death might threaten a scramble for control. </p><p>In New Hampshire, for example, the 400-member House convened this week with <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-recounts-new-hampshire-concord-government-and-politics-6cc72588ceec514996dd7800c312d794">Republicans holding a razor thin 201-197 majority</a>, with two seats vacant. Slightly more Democrats than Republicans were absent last month when members chose their leader, though, which gave the GOP a bit of breathing room when it <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-hampshire-us-republican-party-democratic-united-states-house-of-representatives-government-and-politics-a3d8e42e12378fcf2a77372273c16ae7">came to re-electing state Rep.

Chris Sununu called the nearly even division a “awesome opportunity” for cooperation.</p><p>“And we have a speaker,” he said, referring to the chaos in Washington. “What a great civics lesson and challenge that we find ourselves in.”</p><p>The margin of control is even narrower in the Pennsylvania House, where the November election gave Democrats hopes of reclaiming the majority in the often bitterly partisan chamber after more than a decade.</p><p>Their 102-101 margin included one Democratic incumbent who died a few weeks before being reelected, however, and two others who resigned after winning election to higher offices.</p><p>The House’s top Republican is claiming majority status as a result and has sued to delay filling two of the vacancies. When lawmakers convened on Tuesday to take oaths of office and pick a speaker, the deadlock was broken only when all seven members of GOP leadership and nine other Republicans joined all Democrats <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-pennsylvania-united-states-house-of-representatives-77f099288798d491c28825362576a7d0">to elect Democratic state Rep. Mark Rozzi</a>, of the Reading area, as House speaker.</p><p>Rozzi promised to act as an independent, saying he would caucus with neither party. </p><p>“The speakership is a nonpartisan — and I want to repeat that, nonpartisan — officer of the House, entrusted with maintaining the integrity of the House,” he told reporters Tuesday night. “That will be my focus as speaker.”</p><p>Bipartisanship was also the byword in Ohio, which saw a <a href="https://apnews.com/politics-united-states-house-of-representatives-ohio-a93d55bd0fce6ba35653efac890a35d8">surprising turn in its speaker's race</a> on Tuesday despite Republicans holding a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-supreme-court-ohio-legislature-religion-a53eae689ac8a0b73bb166c610b82c11">formidable supermajority</a> in the Ohio House.</p><p>Though Republican state Rep. Derek Merrin had appeared to seal the deal in a preliminary vote before the holidays, the conservative's hopes were dashed at the last minute by a deal between more moderate GOP backers of rival Rep. Jason Stephens and the House Democratic caucus.</p><p>“I intend to listen, and I intend to be very open and receptive to all members of the Ohio House,” Stephens said after winning the speakership with more Democratic votes than Republican ones. “We represent all of Ohio.” </p><p>Political scientist Niven called Stephens' election in Ohio “mountain-moving,” making a pivot away from the hyper conservative politics that the state has seen in recent years. Meanwhile, McCarthy's efforts to appease his far-right detractors in Washington rather than to work with Democrats may leave GOP moderates in Washington wanting, he said.</p><p>“I think there is a lesson here that there are some very happy Republicans in the Ohio Legislature because they were willing to see beyond their own caucus, and there are Republicans in the U.S. House who, in the end, aren’t going to get what they want because they aren’t willing to take a few steps across the aisle,” he said. </p><p>Deal-making across party lines has long been a part of governing, including within state legislatures. In Alaska, state lawmakers have a history of crossing party lines to form majorities. In North Carolina, a notorious yet effective power-sharing deal for speaker was struck in 2003, allowing a Democrat and Republican to preside over sessions on alternate days.</p><p>House Republicans at the time included Rep. Patrick McHenry, who is now a congressman and one of Kevin McCarthy’s top lieutenants.</p><p>Criminal investigations later led GOP North Carolina Rep. Michael Decker, whose switch to the Democrats in 2003 caused a seat deadlock between the parties, to admit in federal court that he took $50,000 in exchange for supporting Democrat Jim Black for speaker. Decker received prison time, as did Black, who accepted punishment in state court for bribing Decker without pleading guilty to the charge.</p><p>This year, it remains to be seen whether unusual legislative deals are functional. In New Hampshire, Ohio and Pennsylvania, some typically routine operational issues have been rancorous — or left in limbo.</p><p>The all-important vote on Pennsylvania House rules for the next session did not take place, as it normally does, immediately after Rozzi was elected speaker. The House has yet to determine how many members of each party will make up committees, much less the members’ individual committee assignments. </p><p>Rozzi promised a bipartisan staff, but nothing has been announced. </p><p>Republican House Leader Bryan Cutler of Lancaster County, who argues his caucus’ total of 101 current members makes him majority leader, said the choice of Rozzi was “absolutely bipartisan in nature, and I think you saw that trend, kind of, across the country. I think that kind of bipartisanship is good, I think us taking that first step is good.”</p><p>Session dates and committee assignments also have not been announced in the Ohio House, where Stephens, the House speaker, was scrambling after his surprise victory to pick a leadership team, hire a staff and unify his caucus. Matters for the chamber — which must begin deliberations on Ohio's two-year state operating budget soon — were potentially complicated Friday. That's when the Ohio Republican Party’s central committee voted to censure the GOP lawmakers who joined Democrats in supporting Stephens. Champions of the move called their actions a betrayal.</p><p>In New Hampshire, lawmakers divided over proposed rules changes that reflected the dramatically divided House, including grappling with the extra importance of attendance over the next two years.</p><p>One rejected rule change would have allowed members unable to attend sessions because of illness to vote by proxy. Supporters argued that the change would help members stay healthy while also fulfilling their duty to constituents, but — even amid rising COVID-19 infections — the proposal failed.</p><p>___</p><p>Scolforo reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>MISSION, Kan. (AP) — When Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick asked Texas colleges to disavow critical race theory, the University of Texas faculty approved a resolution defending their freedom to decide for themselves how to teach about race. </p><p>Patrick said he took it as a message to “go to hell.”</p><p>In turn, Patrick, a Republican, said it was time to consider holding the faculty accountable, by targeting one of the top perks of their jobs.</p><p>“Maybe we need to look at tenure,” Patrick said at a news conference in November. </p><p>It’s a sentiment being echoed by conservative officials in red states across the country. The indefinite academic appointments that come with tenure — the holy grail of university employment — have faced review from lawmakers or state oversight boards in at least half a dozen states, often presented as bids to rein in academics with liberal views. </p><p>Tenure advocates are bracing for the possibility of new threats as lawmakers return to statehouses around the country. </p><p>The trend reflects how <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-ohio-education-elections-9ff6cfd34f811e91335db2b1a20e7754">conservative scrutiny</a> of instruction related to race, gender and sexuality has extended from schools to higher education. But budget considerations also play a role. Tenured faculty numbers have been declining even in more liberal states. Universities are hiring more part-time, adjunct instructors amid declines in financial support from state governments. </p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="4f0fe0c5c18ed227fabae3744e8ff51d">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Traditionally, tenured professors can be terminated only under extreme circumstances, such as professional misconduct or a financial emergency. Advocates for tenure say it is a crucial component of academic freedom — especially as controversy grows over scholarly discussions about history and identity. </p><p>Without tenure, faculty are “liable to play it safe when it comes time to have a classroom discussion about a difficult topic,” said Irene Mulvey, president of the American Association of University Professors.</p><p>But in difficult financial and political times, even tenured professors may not be guaranteed employment.</p><p>In Kansas, Emporia State University this fall cut 33 faculty — most of them tenured — using an emergency pandemic measure that allowed universities to bypass policies on staff terminations to balance budgets. </p><p>Max McCoy, Emporia State’s sole journalism professor, penned a column that began, <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2022/09/13/emporia-state-university-is-about-to-suspend-tenure-heres-why-you-should-care/">“I may be fired for writing this”</a> — before learning this would be his last year teaching at the school. </p><p>“This is a purge,” he said. He said all the fired professors were “Democrats or liberal in our thinking.”</p><p>University spokesperson Gwen Larson said individual professors were not targeted for dismissal. She said the cuts followed a review of how demand for academic programs is changing and “where we needed to move in the future.</p><p>Attacks on higher education have been fueled by a shift in how conservatives see colleges and universities, said Jeremy Young, of the free-expression group PEN America. The share of Republicans and independent-leaning Republicans who said higher education was having a negative effect on the country grew from 37% to 59% from 2015 to 2019 in Pew Research Center polling.</p><p>In Texas, university administrators are working behind the scenes to squash anticipated legislation that would target tenure, fearful it will hurt recruitment, said Jeff Blodgett, president of the Texas Conference of AAUP. </p><p>Some people already aren’t applying for university jobs because of the discussions, said Pat Heintzelman, president of the Texas Faculty Association.</p><p>In Florida, a federal judge in November blocked the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ron-desantis-florida-discrimination-business-racial-injustice-a6f340a48989e67669418e85f2986ebf">“Stop-WOKE" Act</a>, a law pushed by Gov. Ron DeSantis that restricts certain race-based conversations and analysis in colleges. The governor’s office is appealing the injunction. Compliance with the law would be part of the criteria for evaluating tenured professors under a review process that the university system’s Board of Governors is weighing.</p><p>“They’ve latched onto the idea that many totalitarian regimes have done over the years, which is if you can stop students from learning about ideas that a political party in power disagrees with, that is one way to stop those ideas from existing in the society at all,” said Andrew Gothard, president of United Faculty of Florida.</p><p>DeSantis, though, has questioned the argument that tenure provides academic freedom. </p><p>“If anything, it’s created more of an intellectual orthodoxy where people that have dissenting views, it's harder for them to be tenured in the first place," he said at a news conference in April. </p><p>In Louisiana, lawmakers set up a task force to study tenure with the Republican-backed resolution noting that students should be confident that courses are free of “political, ideological, religious, or antireligious indoctrination.” Professors raised concerns until they learned the task force’s members were mostly tenure supporters.</p><p>In Georgia, the state’s Board of Regents <a href="https://apnews.com/article/georgia-education-27eaf233e573c0f8ace42244dff79bed">approved</a> a policy that made it easier to remove tenured faculty who have had a negative performance review. Elsewhere, legislation to ban or restrict tenure also has been introduced in recent years in Iowa, South Carolina and Mississippi, but failed to win passage. </p><p>The pushback follows decades of declining rates of tenured faculty. According to the AAUP, 24% of faculty members held full-time tenured appointments in fall 2020, compared with 39% in fall 1987, the first year for which directly comparable information is available.</p><p>Part-time college instructors rarely receive benefits. They frequently must travel from campus to campus to cobble together a living.</p><p>“It’s a nightmare,” said Caprice Lawless, who wrote the “Adjunct Cookbook,” replete with recipes that poorly compensated Ph.D.s can cobble together with food pantry staples. </p><p>“I’ve taken Ph.D.s to foodbanks and watched them cry because they can’t get enough food for their family,” said Lawless, who said she served as a social worker of sorts before retiring two years ago from Front Range Community College in Westminster, Colorado.</p><p>The opposition to tenure has united conservatives for different reasons: Not all share the same concerns about “woke higher education,” said Marc Stein, a San Francisco State University history professor, who has written about the shift to part-time faculty.</p><p>“But,” he said, “if you attack the ‘wokeness’ of higher education and that leads to declining funding for higher education, then economic conservatives are happy.”</p><p>Tenure exploded after World War II when it helped with recruitment as the GI Bill sent enrollment soaring, said Sol Gittleman, a former provost of Tufts University who has written on the issue. Lately, the country has overproduced Ph.D.s, said Gittleman, who predicts tenure will largely disappear in the coming decades outside the top 100 colleges and universities. </p><p>“Critical race theory — that's an excuse,” he said. “If there was a shortage of faculty, you wouldn’t hear that.”</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Paul Weber in Austin, Texas, and Anthony Izaguirre in Tallahassee, Florida, contributed to this report.

Their Macron interview was filmed in Paris in November and broadcast by France Televisions, which said the only rule was: “Anything can be said to the Papotin but, most of all, anything can happen!”</p><p>Macron responded gamefully, even to the probing about <a href="https://apnews.com/article/77ee0fd5fc9049a1a248d4cf463ab9d3">his romance with Brigitte</a>, 24 years his senior. She was Brigitte Auzière, a married mother of three children, when they met at the high school where he was a student and she was a teacher. She later moved to the French capital to join Macron and divorced. They married in 2007. </p><p>“It's not about setting an example or not, you see? When you're in love, the choice isn't yours," Macron said in his defense.</p><p>“She wasn't really my teacher. She was my drama teacher. It's not quite the same,” he additionally ventured, a wiggle-round that Macron himself chuckled at and which provoked peals of laughter and a teasing “he's crafty!” from one of the interviewers sat beside him.</p><p>To another delicate question — “Do you have a lot of dough?” — the former banker said he earns less now as president, without divulging figures.</p><p>On friendship, he said: “It's not the best job to have lots of friends.”</p><p>And of Putin, whom he's met, and <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine">the Russian president's war in Ukraine</a>, the French leader said: “When you meet him like that, he's not unpleasant. That's the paradox.”</p><p>At the end of the half-hour question-and-answer session, Macron thanked his interviewers for a job well done. </p><p>“Your questions took me onto grounds ... where I'd not been in other interviews, with other journalists,” he said.</p>]]></description>

(Harry: The Interview on ITV1 and ITVX at 9pm on January 8/PA via AP)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>LONDON (AP) — Prince Harry is expected to lob more criticism at the U.K. royal family in broadcast interviews to promote his soul-baring <a href="https://apnews.com/article/prince-harry-book-details-ce879703cbc92372e4736313c6cab941">new memoir</a>, which has generated incendiary headlines even before its official release.</p><p>A prerecorded interview with Britain’s ITV is scheduled to air Sunday evening.

He said he feels guilt about not showing emotion when he and his brother Prince William greeted crowds of mourners outside Kensington Palace, Diana’s London home.</p><p>In the book, “Spare,” Harry blames his family’s stiff-upper-lip ethos, saying he had “learned too well … the family maxim that crying is not an option.”</p><p>“There were 50,000 bouquets of flowers to our mother and there we were shaking people’s hands, smiling,” Harry told ITV. “I’ve seen the videos, right, I looked back over it all. And the wet hands that we were shaking, we couldn’t understand why their hands were wet, but it was all the tears that they were wiping away.</p><div id="afs:Card:958899307023" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="7082bf624e4b43826d0cc39ce69f961f">Hub peek embed (apf-entertainment) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“Everyone thought and felt like they knew our mum, and the two closest people to her, the two most loved people by her, were unable to show any emotion in that moment.”</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“Spare” is the latest in a string of public pronouncements by the prince and his wife Meghan since they <a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-canada-entertainment-celebrities-queen-elizabeth-ii-8cb152f4cdd09fc7d312d86c7e704b87">quit royal life</a> and moved to California in 2020, citing what they saw as the media’s racist treatment of Meghan, who is biracial, and a lack of support from the palace. It follows an interview with Oprah Winfrey and a six-part <a href="https://apnews.com/article/king-charles-iii-entertainment-london-meghan-markle-prince-harry-7d92f6e8db06b2694a386eac01cfd38c">Netflix documentary</a> released last month.</p><p>The Associated Press purchased a Spanish-language copy of the book in advance of its publication around the world on Tuesday.</p><p>In the ghostwritten memoir, Harry, 38, describes the couple’s acrimonious split from the royal family in 2020, after their suggestion of a part-time royal role was rejected.

(AP Photo/Jesse Bedayn)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>RIFLE, Colo. (AP) — Debbie Hartman voted for <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/lauren-boebert">Lauren Boebert</a> for Congress in 2020 and again in 2022, delighted by Boebert's unequivocal defense of cultural issues that animate the Republican Party's far right flank. But as Hartman shopped recently at a supermarket in this Rocky Mountain ranching outpost, she had one piece of advice for the Colorado lawmaker.</p><p>“Tone down the nasty rhetoric on occasion and just stick with the point at hand,” said Hartman, 65, a veterinary tech assistant.</p><p>That sentiment reflects Boebert's challenge as she begins her second term in the House. In her relatively short time in Washington, she has built a national profile with a combative style embracing everything from gun ownership to apocalyptic religious rhetoric. Constituents such as Hartman in the Republican-leaning 3rd Congressional District laud Boebert for defending their rights, but cringe at her provocations, contributing to an <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-colorado-race-and-ethnicity-united-states-government-56e2e40f33117db7eca957fac7f0a8db">unexpectedly tight race</a> last year that she won by just 546 votes out of more than 300,000 cast.</p><p>“She tapped into what Trump was doing, and she maybe took it too far in some instances,” said Alex Mason, 27, adding that Boebert, whom he supports, is still more tactful than former President <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>.</p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="548e31f15bcbd1929cfe25975c200421">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>In an interview, Boebert said “this slim victory, it opened my eyes to another chance to do everything that I’ve been promising to do." </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>To the congresswoman, that means being “more focused on delivering the policies I ran on than owning the left,” adding she hoped “to bring the temperature down, to bring unity.”</p><p>For much of past week, however, the temperature on Capitol Hill was only rising. Boebert was a leading voice among a group of lawmakers who refused to support Rep. Kevin McCarthy's bid to become House speaker, a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-house-of-representatives-kevin-mccarthy-government-e986c620149b72030bb418bd5fadb4a2">historic revolt</a> against a party leader. McCarthy <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-house-of-representatives-kevin-mccarthy-us-republican-party-0938c7358f41c83759246f8949ac7c15?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=TopNews&amp;utm_campaign=position_01">finally won</a> the gavel early Saturday morning. </p><p>Some of Boebert's toughest words are increasingly aimed at fellow Republicans, including Rep. <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/marjorie-taylor-greene">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a> of Georgia, another <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-technology-las-vegas-mass-shooting-media-social-media-700f28747d856a9bad22a59674a9afe6">controversial</a> Trump acolyte who was one of McCarthy's most prominent conservative supporters. </p><p>“I have been asked to explain MTG’s beliefs on Jewish space lasers, on why she showed up to a white supremacist conference. ... I’m just not going to go there,” Boebert said over the phone as she rode in a car winding through the high canyons near her hometown of Silt before the speakership vote. “She wants to say all these things and seem unhinged on Twitter, so be it.”</p><p>Boebert, 36, insisted that while she may try to pick fewer fights with the left, she's not going to become a different person even after barely beating an opponent, Democrat Adam Frisch, who had targeted what he called Boebert's “angertainment.” </p><p>“A lot of those on the left have said: ‘Look at your election, are you going to tone it down, little girl?'" she said. “I'm still going to be me.”</p><p>The slim margin has stirred discussion about whether she might be vulnerable in another race next year, with Frisch saying he has received encouragement from lawmakers in Washington to run again..</p><p>But, she said, she's thinking more about what it's like to be a member of the majority party.</p><p>“In the minority, all I had was my voice, the only thing I could do was be loud about the things I’m passionate about,” she said. Now, "We have to lead right now, we have to show Americans that we deserve to be in the majority.”</p><p>People in Boebert’s district, which runs from the ruddy red mesas in Grand Junction that stand sentry over rugged, high-desert terrain to the coal mining hamlets nestled in the Rockies, say the landscape promotes a kind of frontier libertarianism. To many voters, Boebert became a standard-bearer for a rural way of life and values that they feel are being both persecuted and forgotten. </p><p>Larry Clark, who spent 50 years tending to his family’s 160-acre ranch before his relatives sought cash for the land, points to one example. Many more liberal city-dwellers east of the Rockies voted to reintroduce wolves to the Western Slope, where the predators’ prey includes livestock that drives the local economy. </p><p>“They don’t understand what rural life is like," said Clark, who only had encouraging words for Boebert, a staunch opponent of reintroduction. "Send the wolves to Boulder.”</p><p>Even if they've grown wary of her excesses, many of Boebert’s supporters say she’s amplified their concerns nationally and served as an an antidote to progressive Democrats such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. </p><p>Raleigh Snyder, a retired aircraft mechanic in Grand Junction, said Boebert was America’s only chance against “endemic corruption” in Washington. Still, he said “she’s probably going to have to learn to temper her approach, but don’t change her goals.” </p><p>Outside Rifle's City Market, Maryann Tonder said she doesn't want Boebert “even to feel that she has to compromise principles to get stuff done." But, she added, "you can do it in a way that is not over the top.” </p><p>Another Boebert supporter in Rifle, Julie Ottman, who was pushing a cart out of City Market, said, “sometimes you got to give a little bit in order to get.” </p><p>But others are pressing Boebert to stand firm. </p><p>“I don’t want her to bow," said Mike Gush, 64, a coal miner from the small town of Craig. “I would stop supporting her.” </p><p>__</p><p>Jesse Bedayn is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>EL PASO, Texas (AP) — President Joe Biden walked a muddy stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border and inspected a busy port of entry Sunday on his first trip to the region after two years in office, a visit shadowed by the fraught politics of immigration as Republicans try to blame him for the record numbers of migrants crossing into the country.</p><p>At his first stop, the president observed as border officers in El Paso demonstrated how they search vehicles for drugs, money and other contraband. Next, he traveled to a dusty street with abandoned buildings and a small playground. Near the street was a metal border fence that separated the U.S. city from Ciudad Juarez. Biden walked slowly along the border wall, initially joined by two Border Patrol agents.</p><p>In a sign of the deep tensions over immigration, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, handed Biden a letter upon his arrival in the state that said the “chaos” at the border was a “direct result” of the president's failure to enforce federal laws. Biden later took the letter out of his jacket pocket during his tour, telling reporters, “I haven't read it yet.”</p><p>Asked what he’s learned by seeing the border firsthand and speaking with the officers who work along it, Biden said: “They need a lot of resources. We’re going to get it for them.”</p><div id="afs:Card:130243251955" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="2e30ea26bbc55c7af509a6e60ad3d33c">Hub peek embed (JoeBiden) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Immigration for years has been a serious point of conflict, exposing both the dysfunction of the U.S. system as well as the turmoil within migrants' home countries that has pushed many to flee. Administration officials have tried to counter Republican criticism by saying Congress should work with them to increase border security funding and overhaul immigration policy.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Biden was spending just a few hours in <a href="https://www.elpasotexas.gov/Migrant-Crisis">the city</a>, which is currently the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-el-paso-united-states-government-cuba-82701453fb018778c04255c1e2b10564">biggest corridor for illegal crossings</a>, in large part due to Nicaraguans fleeing repression, crime and poverty in their country. They are among migrants from four countries who are now subject to quick expulsion under <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-mexico-immigration-af0643a4fb8f45388fe247e44c9b2c5e">new rules enacted by the Biden administration</a> in the past week that drew strong criticism from immigration advocates.</p><p>The president also was to visit the El Paso County Migrant Services Center and meet with nonprofits and religious groups that support migrants arriving to the U.S. It was not clear whether he would talk to any migrants.</p><p>Biden's announcement on border security and his visit to the border are aimed in part at quelling the political noise and blunting the impact of upcoming investigations into immigration promised by House Republicans. But any enduring solution will require action by the sharply divided Congress, where multiple efforts to enact sweeping changes have failed in recent years.</p><p>From El Paso, Biden was to continue south to Mexico City, where <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-mexico-government-us-national-security-council-united-states-599d640834d079503c5dd568c312c19f">he and the leaders of Mexico and Canada will gather</a> on Monday and Tuesday for a North American leaders summit. Immigration is among the items on the agenda.</p><p>In El Paso, where migrants congregate at bus stops and in parks before traveling on, border patrol agents stepped up security before Biden's visit.</p><p>“I think they’re trying to send a message that they’re going to more consistently check people’s documented status, and if you have not been processed they are going to pick you up,” said Ruben Garcia of the Annunciation House aid group in El Paso.</p><p>Migrants and asylum-seekers fleeing violence and persecution have increasingly found that protections in the United States are available primarily to those with money or the savvy to find someone to vouch for them financially.</p><p>Venezuelan migrant Jose Castillo, who said he traveled without family members for five months from his home on Margarita Island to arrive in El Paso on Dec. 29, said he hoped Biden “will take us into consideration as the human beings we are.”</p><p>Castillo was among a group of about 30 migrants who gathered for prayers Sunday morning outside the Sacred Heart Catholic Church where many of the newcomers have been camping.</p><p>“We have suffered a lot since entering the jungle of the Darien Gap and passing through Mexico. It has all been a battle, battle, battle,” he said. “I know that we are here illegally, but please give us a chance.”</p><p>The numbers of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border has risen dramatically during Biden’s first two years in office. There were more than 2.38 million stops during the year that ended Sept. 30, the first time the number topped 2 million. The administration has struggled to clamp down on crossings, reluctant to take hard-line measures that would resemble those of former President Donald Trump's administration.</p><p>The policy changes announced this past week are Biden's biggest move yet to contain illegal border crossings and will turn away tens of thousands of migrants arriving at the border. At the same time, 30,000 migrants per month from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela will get the chance to come to the U.S. legally as long as they travel by plane, get a sponsor and pass background checks. </p><p>The U.S. will also turn away migrants who do not seek asylum first in a country they traveled through en route to the U.S. Migrants are being asked to complete a form on a phone app so that they they can go to a port of entry at a pre-scheduled date and time.</p><p>Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters aboard Air Force One that the administration is trying to “incentivize a safe and orderly way and cut out the smuggling organizations,” saying the policies are “not a ban at all" but an attempt to protect migrants from the trauma that smuggling can create.</p><p>The changes were welcomed by some, particularly leaders in cities where migrants have been massing. But Biden was excoriated by immigrant advocate groups, which accused him of taking measures modeled after those of the former president.

(Ronen Zvulun/Pool Photo via AP)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel on Sunday revoked the Palestinian foreign minister's VIP travel permit, part of a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-israel-palestinian-territories-government-middle-east-f795eb80d0c96c185cd2a3c6ea81119f">series of punitive steps</a> against the Palestinians that Israel's new hard-line government announced days ago.</p><p>Riad Malki said in a statement that he was returning from the Brazilian president's inauguration when he was informed that Israel rescinded his VIP travel permit, which allows top Palestinian officials to travel more easily in and out of the occupied West Bank than ordinary Palestinians. It was not clear whether the permits of other officials had been revoked as well.</p><p>Israel's government on Friday approved the steps to penalize the Palestinians in retaliation for them pushing the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-israel-government-west-bank-united-nations-dff4f816f0962eeeb16527caf763a695">U.N.’s highest judicial body</a> to give its opinion on the Israeli occupation. Rulings by the International Court of Justice are not binding, but they can be influential on world opinion.</p><p>The decision highlights the tough line the current government is already taking toward the Palestinians just days into its tenure. It comes at a time of spiking violence in the occupied West Bank and as peace talks are a distant memory.</p><p>In east Jerusalem, a flashpoint of Israeli-Palestinian tensions, Israeli police said they broke up a meeting by Palestinian parents about their children’s education, claiming it was unlawfully funded by the Palestinian Authority. Police said the operation came at the behest of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-religion-jerusalem-israel-benjamin-netanyahu-189ef3fc8c82d7163c1339e64bb1e40f">National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir</a>, an ultranationalist with a long record of anti-Arab rhetoric and stunts who now oversees the police.</p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="91ba538476380a16aad4e2cbdae2e235">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The Palestinians condemned the revoking of Malki's permit, saying Israel should be the one being “punished for its violations against international law.”</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a meeting of his Cabinet on Sunday the measures against the Palestinians were aimed at what he called “an extreme anti-Israel” step at the U.N. Israel’s Defense Ministry confirmed that Malki's permit had been revoked. Malki's office said he was still permitted to travel like ordinary Palestinians, but had lost the VIP privileges that allow him to bypass lines and move quickly through Israeli checkpoints or through the West Bank's crossing into Jordan.</p><p>On Friday, the government's Security Cabinet decided Israel would withhold $39 million from the Palestinian Authority and transfer the funds instead to a compensation program for the families of Israeli victims of Palestinian militant attacks.</p><p>It also said Israel would further deduct revenue it typically transfers to the cash-strapped PA — a sum equal to the amount the authority paid last year to families of Palestinian prisoners and those killed in the conflict, including militants implicated in attacks against Israelis. The Palestinian leadership describes the payments as necessary social welfare, while Israel says the so-called Martyrs’ Fund incentivizes violence. Israel’s withheld funds threaten to exacerbate the PA’s fiscal woes.</p><p>The Security Cabinet also targeted Palestinian officials directly, saying it would deny benefits to “VIPs who are leading the political and legal war against Israel.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Israel's new defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said he was stripping three senior Palestinian officials of VIP privileges allowing them to enter Israel. The move came after they visited an Arab citizen of Israel who was released from prison last week after serving 40 years for the murder of an Israeli soldier.</p><p>The police operation Saturday came days after Ben-Gvir took office. Police alleged the parents' meeting was funded by the Palestinian Authority and attended by PA activists, which it said was in violation of Israeli law. Police said they prevented the meeting from taking place and that they were operating under an order by Ben-Gvir to shut it down. Police declined to provide evidence backing up their claim and a spokesman for Ben-Gvir referred questions to the police.</p><p>Ziad Shamali, head of the Students' Parents' Committees Union in Jerusalem, which was holding the meeting, denied there was any PA involvement, saying it was being held to discuss a shortage of teachers in east Jerusalem schools. He said he viewed the claim of PA ties as “a political pretext to ban” the meeting.</p><p>The Palestinian Authority was created to administer Gaza and parts of the occupied West Bank. Israel opposes any official business being carried out by the PA in east Jerusalem, and police have in the past broken up events they alleged were linked to the PA.</p><p>Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed it, a move unrecognized by most of the international community. Israel considers the city its undivided, eternal capital. The Palestinians seek the city's eastern sector as the capital of their hoped-for state.</p><p>About a third of the city's population is Palestinian and they have long faced neglect and discrimination at the hands of Israeli authorities, including in education, housing and public services.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Tia Goldenberg in Tel Aviv contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

Then came tears during the playing of the American anthem when her thoughts turned to her father, Jeff, who died three years ago.</p><p>“My dad used to be there and taking pictures. Most races these days I’ll think about him and I’m able to kind of refocus,” Shiffrin said. “But when I’m singing the national anthem (it's different). It was just before I ever won my first World Cup, he said, ‘You better memorize the words of the national anthem, because if you ever win, you better sing it.’ And so I always think about him when I’m up there.”</p><p>There were also an emotional embrace between Shiffrin and her mother, Eileen, who has coached the skier since childhood and been with her daughter every step of the way since her first World Cup win slightly more than a decade ago.</p><p>Shiffrin led from start to finish to win a giant slalom by a large margin and can now break Vonn’s mark in a night slalom scheduled for Flachau, Austria, on Tuesday.</p><div id="afs:Card:541131129162" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="aa16eabb472c4d020dce712ba18530f3">Hub peek embed (Skiing) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“I was so nervous this run. I have a rash on my face I was so nervous,” Shiffrin said. “I don’t know why, maybe a little bit was because of 82. I just really wanted to ski well, and I did."</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Where other skiers struggled on a dark, bumpy and unusually steep course, Shiffrin was able to ski smoothly.</p><p>“It was a fight. But it was pretty amazing conditions and I got a report from the coaches and they were like, ‘It’s really attackable, so just go for it,’" she said. "I’ve been in this position before and I’ve given it away and today I wanted to fight for it.”</p><p>Already with eight wins this season, Shiffrin is also quickly approaching Ingemar Stenmark’s overall record — between men and women — of 86 victories.</p><p>Vonn retired four years ago when injuries ended her pursuit of Stenmark's record.</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/sports-mikaela-shiffrin-lindsey-vonn-austria-alpine-skiing-ec3a0095dd2ae28da59e33402c706dee">Vonn wrote in an AP diary</a> that “if anyone is to break my record, I’m really happy that it’s an American.”</p><p>Shiffrin and Vonn now each have 20 more wins than the next woman on the all-time list, Annemarie Moser-Pröll of Austria at 62.</p><p>While the often-injured Vonn required 395 races for her 82 wins, Shiffrin has done it in just 233 races. And at age 27, Shiffrin could compete for several more years and win many more races.</p><p>“I knew from the very beginning that she would be the one to break all the records,” Vonn wrote. “But to be able to do it at such a young age is really impressive.”</p><p>Shiffrin’s achievement comes almost a year after <a href="https://apnews.com/article/winter-olympics-alpine-skiing-mikaela-shiffrin-out-86aee863c85786ed642524434604acf0">a disappointing performance at the Beijing Olympics</a>, when she competed in six events without winning a medal.</p><p>Winning this race, though, never really seemed in doubt.</p><p>On an overcast morning, Shiffrin was the first starter and laid down a much more aggressive opening run than either of her two trips down the steep Podkoren course on Saturday, when she finished in a tie for sixth.</p><p>“I couldn’t ski faster,” Shiffrin said after her first run. “I felt much, much better this first run than yesterday. I had to try to change my feeling from yesterday. It was very good skiing and I’m happy with that.”</p><p>Shiffrin was the last skier to start the second run and increased her advantage at every checkpoint to finish a whopping 0.77 seconds ahead of Italy’s Federica Brignone and 0.97 ahead of Switzerland’s Lara Gut-Behrami.</p><p>“She was almost perfect,” said Brignone, a former overall World Cup champion. “When she’s skiing like that she’s unbeatable.”</p><p>Added Gut-Behrami, the reigning world champion in giant slalom and the Olympic super-G champion, “It’s good to have these athletes that are making history. Without that, we wouldn’t be so addicted to sport.”</p><p>With few American fans at the race near the Italian border, supporters of Slovakian rival Petra Vlhova cheered Shiffrin loudly. A few kids were waving American flags and family members of Paula Moltzan, another American skier, were on hand wearing USA hockey jerseys.</p><p>Shiffrin also moved ahead of Moser-Pröll and Tessa Worley of France with her 17th giant slalom win for second on the women’s career list behind only Vreni Schneider, the Swiss skier who won 20.</p><p>New Zealand skier Alice Robinson was the victim of an ugly fall during her second run, crashing face first into the snow, but she quickly got up and skied to the bottom.</p><p>___</p><p>Andrew Dampf is at https://twitter.com/AndrewDampf</p><p>___</p><p>More AP skiing: https://apnews.com/hub/skiing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>VATICAN CITY (AP) — The public can now visit the tomb of Pope Benedict XVI in the grottoes under St. Peter’s Basilica. </p><p>The pontiff was buried on Jan. 5 immediately following a funeral in St. Peter’s Square. Benedict’s tomb lies in the grottoes under the basilica’s main floor. </p><p>The Vatican announced on Saturday that the public could visit the tomb starting Sunday morning. </p><p>Benedict had lived since 2013 as pope emeritus, following his retirement from the papacy, the first pontiff to do so in 600 years. He died on Dec. 31 at the age of 95, in the Vatican monastery where he spent his last years. </p><p>On Thursday, his longtime secretary, Archbishop Georg Gaenswein, imparted a final blessing after Benedict's body, contained inside three coffins — the cypress one displayed in the square during the funeral presided over by Pope Francis, a zinc one and an outer one hewn from oak — were lowered into a space in the floor.</p><p>The remains were placed in the former tomb of Benedict's predecessor, St. John Paul II. John Paul's remains were moved up to a chapel on the main floor of the basilica following his 2011 beatification. </p><p>Some 50,000 people attended Benedict's funeral, following three days of the body's lying in state in the basilica, an event which drew nearly 200,000 viewers. </p><div id="afs:Card:057759945916" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="9e77ccb8c66b4566666e6f0172cff249">Hub peek embed (PopeFrancis) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>The name of Benedict, the Catholic church's 265th pontiff, was engraved on a white marble slab, the Vatican said.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The Vatican didn't say whether Pope Francis had privately visited the completed tomb of Benedict before public viewing was permitted, or might do so at some other time. </p><p>On Sunday morning, Francis was leading a ceremony for the baptism of 13 babies in the Sistine Chapel. The chapel, frescoed by Michelangelo, is the traditional setting for the baptisms, an event which closes out the Vatican's year-end ceremonies.</p><p>Later, greeting pilgrims and tourists gathered in St. Peter’s Square for his Sunday noon blessing, Francis quoted from a 2008 homily by Benedict, in which the late pontiff spoke about salvation. </p><p>Drawing inspiration from his predecessor’s words, Francis said that the faithful when judging others, including in the Catholic church, should apply not harshness but mercy, “sharing the wounds and the fragilities” and avoiding divisions.</p><p>Francis has been criticized in some quarters by those who favored Benedict’s more conservative stances because his funeral homily made only a mere mention of the late pontiff. While Benedict and Francis had openly spoken of each other with respect, tensions festered for years between loyalists of both men.</p><p>___</p><p>Gregorio Borgia contributed from the Vatican.</p>]]></description>

Nowadays, the custom lives on as a popular festival that has been drawing crowds of tourists.</p><p>The so-called ‘dancing bears festival’ takes place every December, starting in the days before Christmas and ending with New Year's Eve.</p><p>Hundreds of bear-costumed people of all ages roam villages and towns while dancing to the deafening sound of drums. The festival has done wonders for local tourism but has triggered criticism from animal rights groups over the use of real bear skins.</p><div id="81031262a7b3497097bfdc4cf1b8df6a" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Locals say that the custom dates back to the pre-Christianity era when it was believed that wild animals guarded people from misfortune or danger. Dancing bears, therefore, went to people's homes and knocked on their doors for luck and a happy new year. </p><p>Brown bears are widely present in Romania’s tradition and culture, and often can be seen by mountain roads and in forests. Excessive bear hunting prompted the authorities to issue a ban in 2016, except when the numbers grow too big or in case of illness.</p><div id="afs:Content:584136664175" class="hub-link-embed">Full Coverage: Photography</div><p>The festival highlight falls on Dec. 30, when hundreds of bear-clad people — some 30 bands from all over the region — descend on the regional center of Comanesti for the finale of the street festivities.</p><div id="f714b0fa56c24b73ba9a139931963760" class="media-placeholder"></div><div id="cf492685226d4b898b169ed1c6e29997" class="media-placeholder"></div><div id="1e7438e16165499bb0a7cf1261d70dc5" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Residents are happy that the tradition has lived on since many people left the region in 1990s looking for jobs in Western Europe after the fall of Communism. </p><p>Visitors come from as far away as Japan for the sight: rows and rows of gaping jaws and claws marching and dancing. Giant, red pom-pom decorations are added to the furs to give them the look of a marching band. </p><p>Some of the ‘bears’ jokingly growl or mock an attack on onlookers. More festival-goers, wearing glittering drummers' costumes or tweaked Communist-era military outfits, also routinely join in. </p><div id="49a8f5374b8d4bb68bee48960ed435db" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Wearing a full-sized bear fur isn't easy — with both the head and claws included, the fur could weigh up to 50 kilograms (110 pounds). And, the price might exceed 2,000 euros ($2,100), according to local media.</p><p>Animal rights groups have expressed concern that the festival fuels bear hunting for costumes. Participants defend the event, saying that most of the furs have been preserved for generations and treated with great care.</p><p>Another local tradition in Romania, the forcing taming of bears in captivity to dance for audiences, was curbed decades ago to halt animal abuse. </p><div id="ea0251684170453e9f4590b2a0b3575e" class="media-placeholder"></div><div id="7db64458d3b2426ab6f1a5c19eda74f3" class="media-placeholder"></div><div id="cdfab7b8bf884d51aacc3c69d0c1146e" class="media-placeholder"></div><div id="0e065c94cd444f92b2aa0273079684e3" class="media-placeholder"></div><div id="6bcc81ea80bd49a08ad5710c43e1ed22" class="media-placeholder"></div><div id="c0c469bd85e447f89e1c7bde6547dc4d" class="media-placeholder"></div><div id="17c47dec8e594fbbab4ae944239bffa8" class="media-placeholder"></div><div id="e8976d3b33b04bfc8a07c15b1e9fd2c0" class="media-placeholder"></div><div id="ab3943cc1250413e9b154a4c6c5dde17" class="media-placeholder"></div><div id="74cdafa60e834eba91d6ef1bd9c767e1" class="media-placeholder"></div><div id="1df2dddc12b94f979a0ce9c23a3a41df" class="media-placeholder"></div><div id="18c24bb1024447eb9e184817169f818f" class="media-placeholder"></div><div id="f6df565cdff34f4f879a370af2451146" class="media-placeholder"></div><div id="8b85de2d2f06416f9e56a7dbdedcbbe0" class="media-placeholder"></div><div id="ea5ad8b9b13d47debdda154633b3dbdc" class="media-placeholder"></div><div id="db745b940faa4f68b2773d899637f890" class="media-placeholder"></div><div id="09822d93e4fd4e92aaaaf65d21869968" class="media-placeholder"></div><div id="892ee2c729f547de95df4ecec18d56cc" class="media-placeholder"></div><div id="422c9669803c4fdeac7c61928291702a" class="media-placeholder"></div>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) — With a scoop and score that will go down in franchise lore, Josh Allen may have put an end to the chaos and disappointment that has defined the Jacksonville Jaguars for the better part of the past decade.</p><p>Allen's <a href="https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1611934514577829890">37-yard fumble return with 2:51 remaining</a> helped the Jaguars beat rival Tennessee 20-16 on Saturday night and secure their first AFC South championship since 2017.</p><p>“I'm speechless,” Jaguars owner Shad Khan said before crediting coach Doug Pederson, general manager Trent Baalke and players. “I’ve always had confidence that we would be getting to where we needed to go.”</p><p>Khan easily could have singled out Allen and safety Rayshawn Jenkins, who forced Josh Dobbs’ fumble. Allen picked up the loose ball on a perfect bounce and ran, untouched, the other way for a lead that held up.</p><p>Dobbs fumbled again on the ensuing possession, and the Jaguars (9-8) started to celebrate their most significant regular-season victory in history.</p><p>“This was one of those games where our defense had to win it for us,” Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence said. "Us guys on offense, we’re a little frustrated because we left a lot out there. But in these games, just win. Our defense picked us up today. They played great.”</p><div id="afs:Card:234821764243" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="245237965ff4389a7d33ce3e58732333">Hub peek embed (NFL) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Jacksonville earned the No. 4 seed in the conference playoffs and will host either the Los Angeles Chargers or Baltimore in the wild-card round next weekend.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>It’s the 18th time in the last 20 seasons that at least one NFL team won its division after finishing last or tied for last the previous year.</p><p>Jacksonville closed the regular season with its fifth consecutive victory and became the fifth team in NFL history to make the playoffs with a five-game losing streak and a five-game winning streak in the same season.</p><p>“We just kept believing,” Lawrence said. “Nobody ever lost faith. Everybody believed in one another. We never started pointing the finger. We lost five games straight and we just got tighter.”</p><p>Tennessee (7-10) lost its final seven games, a skid that had just about everyone writing them off before Saturday’s finale.</p><p>“Nobody wants to finish how we did," Titans running back Derrick Henry said. "That’s never the plan, never the goal. Like I said, stuff happens, adversity happens.</p><p>"We wanted to win the division and have a great record, yeah, but it didn’t happen this year. All you can do is go back to work and be thankful for the journey and everybody in their efforts and look forward.”</p><p>The Titans rested several starters last week and essentially created a 10-day break to get healthy. They returned to their bruising brand of football and looked like they would pull an improbable turnaround — until Dobbs’ turnover changed the game.</p><p>“We just got on a (crappy) streak and couldn’t get off it," Titans coach Mike Vrabel said. "Couldn’t make the plays when we needed to. We couldn’t be consistent enough when we needed to and it showed up again.”</p><p>The Jaguars were 6 1/2-point favorites, according to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sportsbook.fanduel.com">FanDuel Sportsbook</a>, and a near-sellout crowd was on hand to witness what many thought would be more of a coronation than a scratch-and-claw nail-biter.</p><p>The Titans didn’t do anything spectacular. With quarterback Ryan Tannehill (ankle) out for the season, they leaned on Dobbs — an aerospace engineer who has bounced around the league — to be smart with the ball and Henry to grind out tough yards. And they relied on a defense that’s been stout against the run all year.</p><p>It worked for 57 minutes — and then it unraveled.</p><p>Henry finished with 109 yards on 30 carries. Dobbs completed 20 of 29 passes for 179 yards, with a touchdown, an interception and the fumble. </p><p>Lawrence completed 20 of 32 passes for 212 yards, with a touchdown and a fumble. Lawrence had two would-be touchdowns in the second half fall incomplete. He overthrew Zay Jones in the end zone and underthrew Christian Kirk.</p><p>Nearly all of the 70,000-plus on hand were waiting for Lawrence to do something down the stretch. Instead, the Jags became the first team since Carolina in 2000 to pull off a fourth-quarter comeback without gaining a first down in the quarter, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Info.</p><p>STIFF ARM</p><p>Henry <a href="https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1611905881809227776">added another impressive stiff-arm to his highlight reel</a> filled with them. He tossed Jenkins to the ground in the second quarter to cap a 14-yard gain, setting off a flurry of social media posts about the move.</p><p>Henry, who grew up outside Jacksonville in Yulee, finished the first half with 71 yards on the ground, but added just 38 after intermission.</p><p>MEMORABLE MOMENT</p><p>Both teams gathered at midfield together before the game to pray, some of them still wearing shirts to honor Buffalo's Demar Hamlin. Tennessee linebacker Rashad Weaver, college teammates with Hamlin at Pitt, wore Hamlin's No. 3 on his eye black.</p><p>Weaver later recovered Lawrence's fumble on a <a href="https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1611904199033516032">misguided trick play</a> in the first half.</p><p>___</p><p>AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://apnews.com/hub/pro-32 and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>SEATTLE (AP) — The public school district in Seattle has filed a novel lawsuit against the tech giants behind TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Snapchat, seeking to hold them accountable for the mental health crisis among youth.</p><p>Seattle Public Schools filed the lawsuit Friday in U.S. District Court. The 91-page complaint says the social media companies have created a public nuisance by targeting their products to children. </p><p>It blames them for worsening mental health and behavioral disorders including anxiety, depression, disordered eating and cyberbullying; making it more difficult to educate students; and forcing schools to take steps such as hiring additional mental health professionals, developing lesson plans about the effects of social media, and providing additional training to teachers. </p><p>“Defendants have successfully exploited the vulnerable brains of youth, hooking tens of millions of students across the country into positive feedback loops of excessive use and abuse of Defendants’ social media platforms,” the complaint said. “Worse, the content Defendants curate and direct to youth is too often harmful and exploitive ....”</p><p>While federal law — Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act — helps protect online companies from liability arising from what third-party users post on their platforms, the lawsuit argues that provision does not protect the tech giants’ behavior in this case.</p><div id="afs:Card:604728406135" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="965a8f373e3bfed8157571912cc3b542">Hub peek embed (apf-business) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“Plaintiff is not alleging Defendants are liable for what third-parties have said on Defendants’ platforms but, rather, for Defendants’ own conduct,” the lawsuit said. “Defendants affirmatively recommend and promote harmful content to youth, such as pro-anorexia and eating disorder content.”</p><p>In emailed statements Sunday, Google and Snap said they had worked to protect young people who use their platforms. </p><p>Snap launched an in-app support system called Here For You in 2020, to help those who might be having a mental health or emotional crisis find expert resources, and it also has enabled settings that allow parents to see whom their children contact on Snapchat, though not the content of those messages. It also has recently expanded content about the new 988 suicide and crisis phone system in the U.S.</p><p>"We will continue working to make sure our platform is safe and to give Snapchatters dealing with mental health issues resources to help them deal with the challenges facing young people today,” the company said in a written statement. </p><p>José Castañeda, a spokesperson for Google, said Google, which owns YouTube, had also given parents the ability to set reminders, limit screen time and block certain types of content on their children's devices. </p><p>“We have invested heavily in creating safe experiences for children across our platforms and have introduced strong protections and dedicated features to prioritize their well being," Castañeda said. </p><p>Meta and TikTok did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The lawsuit says that from 2009 to 2019, there was on average a 30% increase in the number of Seattle Public Schools students who reported feeling “so sad or hopeless almost every day for two weeks or more in a row" that they stopped doing some typical activities.</p><p>The school district is asking the court to order the companies to stop creating the public nuisance, to award damages, and to pay for prevention education and treatment for excessive and problematic use of social media.</p><p>While hundreds of families are pursuing lawsuits against the companies over harms they allege their children have suffered from social media, it's not clear if any other school districts have filed a complaint like Seattle's. </p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/hub/the-facebook-papers">Internal studies revealed by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen in 2021</a> showed that the company knew that Instagram negatively affected teenagers by harming their body image and making eating disorders and thoughts of suicide worse. She alleged that the platform prioritized profits over safety and hid its own research from investors and the public.</p>]]></description>

Despite the risk of new infections, the reopening that will allow tens of thousands of people who have made prior online bookings to cross each day is expected to provide a much-needed boost to Hong Kong’s tourism and retail sectors. </p><div id="afs:Card:029281580227" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="49e31dedb78fd24c1077b340ebdafa1f">Hub peek embed (apf-Health) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>On a visit to the station Sunday morning, Hong Kong's Chief Executive John Lee said the sides would continue to expand the number of crossing points from the current seven to the full 14.</p><p>“The goal is to get back as quickly as possible to the pre-epidemic normal life," Lee told reporters. “We want to get cooperation between the two sides back on track."</p><p>Communist Party newspaper Global Times quoted Tan Luming, a port official in Shenzhen on the border with Hong Kong, saying about 200 passengers were expected to take the ferry to Hong Kong, while another 700 were due to travel in the other direction, on the first day of reopening. Tan said a steady increase in passenger numbers is expected over coming days. </p><p>“I stayed up all night and got up at 4 a.m. as I’m so excited to return to the mainland to see my 80-year-old mother," a Hong Kong woman identified only by her surname, Cheung, said on arrival at Shenzhen, where she was presented with “roses and health kits," the paper said. </p><p>Hong Kong media reports said around 300,000 travel bookings from the city to mainland China have already been made, with a daily quota of 60,000. </p><p>Limited ferry service also was restored from China's Fujian province to the Taiwanese-controlled island of Kinmen just off the Chinese coast.</p><p>The border crossing with Russia at Suifenhe in the far northern province of Heilongjiang also resumed normal operations, just in time for the opening of the ice festival in the capital of Harbin, a major tourism draw. </p><p>And at Ruili, on the border with Myanmar, normal operations were resumed after 1,012 days of full or partial closure in response to repeated outbreaks blamed partly on visitors from China's neighbor. </p><p>So far, only a fraction of the previous number of international flights are arriving at major Chinese airports. </p><p>Beijing's main Capital International Airport was expecting eight flights from overseas on Sunday. Shanghai, China's largest city, received its first international flight under the new policy at 6:30 a.m. with only a trickle of others to follow. </p><p>Since March 2020, all international passenger flights bound for Beijing have been diverted to designated first points of entry into China. Passengers were required to quarantine up to three weeks.</p><p>“I’ve been under isolated quarantine for six times in different cities (in mainland China),” said Ivan Tang, a Hong Kong business traveler. “They were not easy experiences.” </p><p>Ming Guanghe, a Chinese living in Singapore, said it had been difficult both to book a ticket and find somewhere to take a PCR test. Quarantine measures and uncertainty about outbreaks had kept him away from home, Ming said. </p><p>Shanghai announced it would again start issuing regular passports to Chinese for foreign travel and family visits, as well as renewing and extending visas for foreigners. Those restrictions have had a particularly devastating effect on foreign businesspeople and students in the key Asian financial center. </p><p>China is now <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-health-china-government-beijing-762d314d452875ecc525d5c21dbfa541">facing a surge in cases and hospitalizations</a> in major cities and is bracing for a further spread into less developed areas with the start of its most important holiday, the Lunar New Year, in coming days. </p><p>Authorities say they expect domestic rail and air journeys will double over the same period last year, bringing overall numbers close to those of the 2019 holiday period before the pandemic hit.</p><p>Meanwhile, more foreign governments are imposing testing requirements on travelers from China — most recently Germany, Sweden and Portugal. On Saturday, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock urged citizens to avoid “unnecessary” travel to China, noting the rise in coronavirus cases and China’s “overburdened” health system.</p><p>The German regulation also allows for spot checks on arrival. Germany, like other European nations, will test wastewater from aircrafts for possible new virus variants. The measures come into force at midnight Monday and are due to last until April 7.</p><p>Apparently concerned about its reputation, China says the testing requirements aren’t science-based and has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-health-china-government-beijing-762d314d452875ecc525d5c21dbfa541">threatened unspecified countermeasures.</a></p><p>Chinese health authorities publish a daily count of new infections, severe cases and fatalities, but those numbers include only officially confirmed cases and use a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-china-covid-d130817ed350e805295ee16c50ae6a46">very narrow definition of COVID-19-related deaths. </a></p><p>The National Health Commission on Sunday reported 7,072 new confirmed cases of local transmission and two new deaths — even as individual provinces were reporting as many as 1 million cases per day. </p><p>Authorities say that since the government ended compulsory testing and permitted people with mild symptoms to test themselves and convalesce at home, it can no longer provide a full picture of the outbreak. China’s vulnerabilities are increased by the population’s general lack of exposure to the virus and a relatively low vaccination rate among the elderly.</p><p>Government spokespeople insist the situation is under control and reject accusations from the World Health Organization and others that they're not being transparent about the outbreak that could lead to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/science-health-china-covid-306b688d84e31a9462f82d0ead1f4584">the emergence of new variants. </a></p><p>The Health Commission on Saturday rolled out regulations for strengthened monitoring of viral mutations, including testing of urban wastewater. The rules called for increased data gathering from hospitals and local government health departments and stepped-up checks on “pneumonia of unknown causes.” </p><p>Criticism has largely focused on heavy-handed enforcement of regulations, including open-ended travel restrictions that saw people confined to their homes for weeks, sometimes sealed inside without adequate food or medical care. </p><p>Anger was also vented over the requirement that anyone who potentially tested positive or had been in contact with such a person be confined for observation in a field hospital, where overcrowding, poor food and hygiene were commonly cited.</p><p>The social and economic costs eventually prompted rare street protests in Beijing and other cities, possibly influencing the Communist Party’s decision to swiftly ease the strictest measures. </p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press journalists Alice Fung and Karmen Li in Hong Kong, Frank Jordans in Berlin, Olivia Zhang, Wayne Zhang and Henry Hou in Beijing contributed to this report. </p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/John Locher)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>LAS VEGAS (AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs don't believe in simply wrapping up the AFC's top seed. They want to have fun doing it.</p><p>Late in the first half Saturday against the Las Vegas Raiders, the Chiefs huddled and spun in a circle, broke out into the shotgun with running back Jerick McKinnon taking a direct snap. He faked a handoff to Kadarius Toney and pitched to quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who then threw to Toney for a 9-yard touchdown.</p><p>But, it didn't count. A holding penalty brought back the play. The Chiefs then scored anyway to take full control of what became a 31-13 victory.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/espn/status/1611855455332012032?s=20&amp;t=YrAkuL5WZGve3GZtT849Kg">The play</a> is called the Snow Globe or Arctic Circle, depending on who is asked. But, even if it didn't count, it underscored the Chiefs' creativity and willingness to have fun, even while playing for playoff positioning and a week off.</p><p>“We talked about it on the side, ‘Let’s see if we can get some confusion going and throw something back.'" Mahomes said. "It worked. We just had the holding penalty. We got some good things going for the playoffs, and whatever we run has to work.”</p><p>That, Chiefs coach Andy Reid said, was the bottom line.</p><p>“You do (want to make it fun), but you want to score, too," Reid said. “It's not fun when you're not doing that.”</p><div id="afs:Card:234821764243" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="5d08f366a1e2319104eb54ce22a570d2">Hub peek embed (NFL) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Almost lost was the NFL record for total yards in a season that Mahomes set. He passed for 202 yards and rushed for 29 against the Raiders, giving him 5,608 total yards this season. That surpassed the record of 5,562 yards set by Drew Brees in 2011 with the New Orleans Saints.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“Pat was on fire,” Reid said. “He's throwing these (statistics) out there like they're nothing.”</p><p>More than setting the mark, Mahomes helped ensure the top seed for the Chiefs (14-3) and a bye in the first round of the playoffs, which begin next weekend. Kansas City, however, is not assured of home-field advantage throughout the postseason.</p><p>Because Monday night’s Buffalo-Cincinnati game was canceled, the Chiefs could wind up playing the Bills or Bengals in the AFC championship on a neutral field. The Buffalo-Cincinnati game initially was postponed after Bills safety Damar <a href="https://apnews.com/article/damar-hamlin-collapse-buffalo-bills-cincinnati-bengals-c9f684bdaccd1e3f77bda6c77baca75e">Hamlin went into cardiac arrest</a>. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/buffalo-bills-nfl-sports-health-damar-hamlin-28a376ee8c719bf344eac27ab689046c">Hamlin remains in critical condition, but is improving.</a></p><p>This was the first NFL game played since Hamlin was hospitalized. Both teams wore black shirts in warmups that read “LOVE FOR DAMAR” with his No. 3 in the middle. Mahomes also wore a hoodie that had a drawing of the player with “HAMLIN STRONG” below it. </p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/buffalo-bills-chicago-bears-detroit-lions-cincinnati-bengals-sports-48092707c1e931283a149919882e41e9">Instead of a moment of silence before the game</a>, the Allegiant Stadium public-address announcer asked fans to cheer on Hamlin's recovery.</p><p>“It was definitely weird,” Mahomes said of returning to the field. “It's a game that you love, you play your entire life. It's brought so many great things to you. But, obviously, with the situation that happened Monday night with Damar, you still have that in the back of your mind. You want to be there for him, and there is so much stuff bigger than football.”</p><p>The Chiefs matched their franchise record for regular-season victories, set in 2020, and they set a team mark with their 17th consecutive game of at least 300 yards of offense.</p><p>The Raiders (6-11) ended their first season under coach Josh McDaniels with three consecutive losses and four defeats in five games. They made the playoffs a year ago, but now face serious questions at quarterback, offensive line and throughout the defense.</p><p>Jarrett Stidham started his second game in a row in place of the sidelined Derek Carr, and this performance didn’t go nearly as well as the first one. Stidham completed 22 of 36 passes for 219 yards with a touchdown and interception. He was sacked six times.</p><p>A week ago, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/The%20Chiefs%20matched%20their%20franchise%20record%20for%20regular-season%20victories%20set%20in%202020,%20and%20they%20set%20a%20team%20mark%20with%20their%2017th%20consecutive%20game%20of%20at%20least%20300%20yards.%20Patrick%20Mahomes%20(stats).%20The%20Raiders%20(6-11)%20ended%20their%20first%20season%20under%20coach%20Josh%20McDaniels%20with%20three%20consecutive%20losses%20and%20four%20defeats%20in%20five%20games.%20They%20made%20the%20playoffs%20a%20year%20ago,%20but%20now%20face%20serious%20questions%20at%20quarterback,%20offensive%20line%20and%20throughout%20the%20defense.%20Jarrett%20Stidham%20started%20his%20second%20game%20in%20a%20row%20in%20place%20of%20the%20sidelined%20Derek%20Carr,%20and%20this%20performance%20didn%E2%80%99t%20go%20nearly%20as%20well%20as%20the%20first%20one.%20Stidham%20(stats),%20and%20he%20was%20sacked%20()%20times.%20A%20week%20ago,%20he%20threw%20for%20365%20yards%20and%20three%20touchdowns%20in%20a%2037-34%20overtime%20loss%20to%20the%20San%20Francisco%2049ers.">he threw for 365 yards and three touchdowns</a> in a 37-34 overtime loss to the San Francisco 49ers.</p><p>Stidham said he hasn't thought much about trying to retain the starting job next season with the Raiders.</p><p>“Do I feel like I'm that caliber player in this league?” he said. “Absolutely. I just tried to be ready for my opportunity these last two weeks and try to take full advantage of it."</p><p>Raiders running back Josh Jacobs, who was dealing with hip and oblique injuries as well as a reported family emergency, was a game-day decision but played. He rushed for 45 yards and could possibly win the NFL rushing title with 1,653 yards.</p><p>But Jacobs fell short of the franchise rushing record of 1,759 yards set by Marcus Allen in 1985. This was potentially Jacobs’ final game as a member of the Raiders because his fifth-year option was not picked up. His performance this season has given Las Vegas officials plenty to consider.</p><p>NOTES</p><p>Chiefs linebacker Nick Bolton made 16 tackles, giving him 180 for the season and breaking the team record of 179 set by Derrick Johnson in 2011. … Kansas City running back Jerick McKinnon has caught a touchdown pass in six consecutive games. He has nine TDs total over that span. … Chiefs rookie defensive end George Karlaftis has 5½ sacks in seven games. … Kansas City tight end Travis Kelce caught six passes for 38 yards, giving him 110 receptions this season, just one off the Chiefs’ mark set by Tyreek Hill last season.</p><p>INJURIES</p><p>Chiefs: DE Frank Clark (groin) went out in the second quarter.</p><p>Raiders: CB Nate Hobbs (hand) and LB Harvey Langi (concussion) went out and didn’t return.</p><p>UP NEXT</p><p>Chiefs: Regular season is over.

McCarthy was elected House speaker on a historic post-midnight 15th ballot early Saturday, overcoming holdouts and floor tensions after a chaotic week. (Jan. 7)</p>    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/kevin-mccarthy">Kevin McCarthy</a> is the new <a href="https://history.house.gov/People/Office/Speakers/">House speaker</a>, but as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-kevin-mccarthy-matt-gaetz-florida-f2a4a42b4845f2413cca5c1b4c6100dd">bruising as it was</a> for him to seize the gavel in a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-house-of-representatives-kevin-mccarthy-us-republican-party-0938c7358f41c83759246f8949ac7c15?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=TopNews&amp;utm_campaign=position_01">history-making election</a>, it may be even more difficult for the embattled leader to do much with the powerful position — or to even keep it.</p><p>Like the two most recent Republican speakers, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/b0149e2c85294a759eaa63755d7596ad">John Boehner</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-america-paul-ryan-ap-top-news-elections-wisconsin-819e75f7fb634531936c8416bf860344">Paul Ryan</a>, McCarthy takes the helm of a restive, rebellious majority <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-us-republican-party-donald-trump-kevin-mccarthy-b6fedeb8ac7a3a543311626493e4943b">split in much the same way as the party itself</a>, between what's left of the Grand Old Party conservatives and a new generation of tea party-to-Donald Trump hard-liners preferring almost no big government at all. </p><p>The chaos that erupted in four days of House voting, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-house-of-representatives-us-republican-party-billy-long-5dc5377382e010d1071c7afbfb694f3b">halting start of the new Congress</a>, is a prelude to the highly uncertain path ahead as McCarthy tries to lead an unruly Republican majority to achieve its priorities and confront President Joe Biden's agenda — and maybe even keep the government from shutting down.</p><p>“This is the great part: Because it took this long, now we learned how to govern,” McCarthy, who was first elected in 2006, suggested as he rounded toward victory.</p><p>McCarthy endured a grueling weeklong fight to get here, a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-house-of-representatives-kentucky-kevin-mccarthy-e177c4405ef9b8a7b38641a15855764c">speaker's election</a> like no other since the eve of the Civil War.

He was forced to roll through 14 ballots before he finally won a majority vote on the 15th vote, but not before the final chaotic scene of shouting between allies and holdouts pushed balloting into early Saturday.</p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="e986c620149b72030bb418bd5fadb4a2">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>In the end, McCarthy emerges as a weakened speaker, one with less authority on paper than those before him. That's particularly true because he agreed to give the hard-right holdouts a key concession: restoring a rule that allows any single lawmaker to make a “motion to vacate the chair,” essentially a vote to oust the speaker from that leadership post.</p><p>But in some ways, the son of gritty Bakersfield, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-bakersfield-california-kevin-mccarthy-congress-5e355091d9f308b1b93a9faaec610d5a">an oil-and-agricultural heartland in central California</a>, also becomes emboldened as a survivor who withstood one of history’s most brutal brawls for power and who prides himself on being an underestimated political fighter.</p><div id="069855bfd0ff4d27a8b6cec77a189ddf" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>“Apparently, I like to make history,” McCarthy quipped at one point during the raucous week.</p><p>McCarthy staked his political career on early backing of Trump, and it was the former president who delivered when needed, making late phone calls to holdouts and “helping get those final votes.” When it was finally over, when McCarthy walked into the speaker's office at the Capitol, the sign bearing his name already was hanging.</p><p>Plenty of tests await.</p><p>Congress faces an agenda of must-pass bills to fund the government, restock a military whose supplies have been depleted by decades of war and aid to Ukraine, authorize farming programs and raise the nation's borrowing limit to avert an unprecedented federal default.</p><p>For the first time as president, Biden will face a divided government, with the House in Republican hands and the Senate still controlled, though narrowly, by Democrats.</p><p>Divided government can be a time of bipartisan deal-making as the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-ketanji-brown-jackson-politics-europe-donald-trump-143cce189228d6563eba07298cc9f8a1">parties come together to accomplish big priorities</a>. But more often it results in brinkmanship that has led to stalemates, standoffs and shutdowns.</p><p>House Republicans are eager to confront Biden with oversight of the White House's handling of the U.S.-Mexico border, the COVID-19 crisis and other issues, along with investigations of Biden, his family and his administration.</p><p>“I came to Washington to challenge the status quo," wrote Republican Bob Good of Virginia in an op-ed before his many votes against McCarthy. “I intend to keep that promise.” Good was one of six Republican who voted “present” in the <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202320">final roll call.</a></p><p>McCarthy has been here before.</p><p>In 2011, tea party Republicans took control of the House, confronting the agenda of President Barack Obama and his vice president, Biden. The movement opposed the Washington political establishment and espoused a conservative and libertarian philosophy, advocating for less spending, lower taxes and reducing the national debt and budget deficit.</p><p>McCarthy helped recruit the tea party class, and he went on to become the third-ranking Republican, part of the “Young Guns” with Ryan of Wisconsin and then-Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia. </p><p>Fueled by the tea party, they went on to lead House Republicans into crisis after crisis with efforts to cut federal spending during the “fiscal cliff” of 2012 and federal shutdowns in 2013 as they tried to repeal Obama's health care program. </p><p>In 2015, when then-Rep. Mark Meadows, the North Carolina Republican who led the Freedom Caucus and later served as Trump's last chief of staff, threatened a “motion to vacate the chair" — a vote to oust the speaker — Boehner chose early retirement. </p><p>McCarthy tried to take Boehner's place, but he dropped out of the race when it was clear he would not have support from conservatives. Ryan ended up with the job. But he, too, retired in the Trump era.</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/hub/nancy-pelosi">Speaker Nancy Pelosi</a>, D-Calif., did away with the “vacate the chair” rule when Democrats regained the majority in 2019. A seasoned legislator who had made history as the first woman to be speaker, Pelosi ran the House with the strength of experience.</p><p>McCarthy has been in office for 15 years, half as long as Pelosi when she first took the helm, and with far fewer legislative victories to speak of. In talks over the past week with the hard-liners, he was forced to reinstate the “motion to vacate the chair” to win over the holdouts. They can now hold it over him every single day.</p><p>“If a CEO is not doing the job, you can fire him — same thing in politics,” said Republican Ralph Norman of South Carolina, one of the holdouts McCarthy won over with the rules changes.</p><p>The chaos that erupted on the House floor this past week may end up as a prelude to the Congress to come.</p><p>“What you saw over the last week,” Norman said, "is how democracy works."</p>]]></description>

(Jan. 6)</p>    <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Without a TV show, starry red carpet, host, press or even a livestream, the <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/golden-globe-awards">Golden Globe Awards</a> were in chaos last year after scandal broke over lack of diversity, accusations of sexism, and ethical and financial lapses among members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.</p><p>Once known as Hollywood’s biggest, booziest party that regularly drew 18 million television viewers, the doling out of statues was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/golden-globe-awards-7807652153518b2df70e636dd22654c2">reduced to a 90-minute private event</a> with no celebrities present at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.</p><p>Winners were announced on Twitter, often without specifying what project a person had actually won for.</p><p>What a difference a year can make.</p><p>After dumping the telecast in the aftermath of a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-02-21/hfpa-golden-globes-2021">damaging expose by the Los Angeles Times</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/golden-globes-return-2023-nbc-fd8fefb130eafdad03807a944f25ea1d">NBC will put the battered 80-year-old Globes</a> back on the air Tuesday under a one-year deal, as opposed to multi-year contracts of the past worth tens of millions of dollars. </p><p>A wave of celebrities plan to attend, along with star presenters and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jerrod-carmichael-golden-globes-host-2023-d60e244c609ad4cf23a6789fdeab6a68">funnyman host Jerrod Carmichael</a> after the embattled controllers of the Globes dug deep into the work of implementing top-down reforms.</p><div id="8e30a7417f284b588fdf017ae3de99ff" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>There’s now a strict code of conduct, refreshed bylaws, a ban on gifts and new rules on accepting travel and other perks from the industry. Contentious news conferences were dumped, and the pool of awards voters was expanded beyond the 87 Los Angeles-based foreign journalists who once ruled the organization.</p><div id="afs:Card:038204960080" content-id="9ee1a25e378b0c707dcd1f5f205c405b" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (apf-TV) - Compressed layout (automatic embed)</div><p>But are the powerful publicists, studios and other stakeholders who boycotted in protest satisfied with the changes? And are those changes the beginning — or closer to the end?</p><p>“It's, by far, not over,” said German journalist Helen Hoehne, who took over as president of the HFPA a year and a half ago. “We always said when we started this journey that it would be ongoing and that it would take some time.”</p><p>Kelly Bush Novak, CEO and founder of the A-list public relations firm ID, said more must be done, but she supports steps taken so far.</p><p>“We came together ... to ensure the future of the Globes, in step with our culture and our shared values as an industry, and we see commendable and seismic progress,” she said. "I’m optimistic that the work will continue.” </p><div id="67353cf0c24b4002a97ccd1c5780352f" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Still, Novak acknowledged not all stakeholders are on board ahead of Tuesday's broadcast, despite sweeping changes aimed at restoring the luster of the Globes.</p><p>Last year, publicists like Novak banded together to battle the HFPA, and studios that included Netflix and WarnerMedia cut ties with the organization after the LA Times raised questions about corruption and a range of bias issues over race and sexual orientation.</p><p>None of the 87 Hollywood Foreign Press Association <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-02-21/hfpa-golden-globes-2021-who-are-the-members#:~:text=2021%20Golden%20Globes%20group%20has%20no%20Black%20members%20%2D%20Los%20Angeles%20Times">members was Black</a> and the group had not had a Black member since at least 2002.</p><p>Now, after an effort to increase and diversify its ranks, 199 people decide who gets a Globe, a mix of 96 HFPA members and outsiders from other countries brought in to dilute the power of the old guard. Membership eligibility was expanded from Los Angeles to anywhere in the United States. </p><p>Heading into the telecast, Globes voters stand at 52% female, and 51.8% racially and ethnically diverse, including 19.6% Latino, 12.1% Asian, 10.1% Black and 10.1% Middle Eastern. Voters also include those who are LGBTQIA+. In all, 62 countries are represented.</p><p>The governing board was expanded from nine to 15 and includes three Black members, two of whom vote on rules and other matters but not awards. Overall, the organization now has six Black HFPA members and 14 Black international Globes voters who aren't members.</p><div id="ece237cd65424ddf9cd9b56219e1c5ce" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Perhaps the most significant change: The Globes were purchased by billionaire Todd Boehly, who also owns the Beverly Hilton, Globes producer dick clark productions and the Chelsea soccer team. He's shifting the voting body from its founding nonprofit status to a for-profit model, pending approval by the California attorney general. He plans to preserve the HFPA's charitable work with a separate nonprofit entity.</p><p>A hotline managed by two independent law firms was opened, with complaints investigated by outsiders. A chief diversity officer was hired, and mandatory racial, sexual harassment and sexual orientation sensitivity training was put in place, required for any HFPA member casting Globe votes.</p><p>Michelle Williams, nominated for her turn in “The Fabelmans,” is among dozens of stars panning to attend Tuesday.</p><p>“It feels to me like the community as a whole has decided that this organization has really done a lot of work to reform themselves and that we can support change, like we can hold people accountable and then we can support them as they continue to journey in their path towards being a better organization,” she said.</p><p>Added Judd Hirsch, nominated for the same film: “We'll be there. We'll give them another chance.”</p><p>Dumping news conferences at the center of insensitive questions posed to talent who felt obligated to show up helped cool off some critics, but not all.</p><p>“I can’t speak for everyone. There may be some reluctance to participate," Novak said. “We must acknowledge the past and will never forget the damage done. Manifesting a new future requires it.”</p><p>Brendan Fraser, nominated for his performance in “The Whale,” <a href="https://apnews.com/article/brendan-fraser-will-not-attend-2023-golden-globes-d09df6c03e4094acf835ec65d2e8bbaa">will not be there Tuesday</a>. In 2018, Fraser said he was groped by Philip Berk, a former HFPA president who is from South Africa. </p><p>Berk <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-race-and-ethnicity-golden-globe-awards-arts-and-entertainment-2bc2531d105cd4e095119a62de57f9bd">was expelled in 2021</a> after calling Black Lives Matter “a racist hate movement.”</p><p>“I just hope that we can regain his trust over time,” Hoehne said of Fraser.</p><div id="96d6dcc4556544d2bdd65950349e0f29" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>The same, Hoehne said, goes for Tom Cruise. Last year, he returned his three Golden Globes in protest. With a best picture nod for his long-awaited sequel “Top Gun: Maverick,” he was snubbed for best actor this year.</p><p>Under Boehly's leadership, HFPA members will earn $75,000 a year as his employees, as opposed to current stipends closer to $5,000. They'll vote on nominations and winners among films and television series submitted for awards consideration. They'll write for the organization's website, and organize other projects, the LA Times said, citing a confidential employee memo it reviewed. </p><p>The 103 new voting non-members recruited with the help of the National Association of Black Journalists, Asian-American Journalists Association and LGBTQIA+ organizations will not be paid, setting up a two-tier structure aimed at eliminating the taint of financial compensation as more new recruits come on board.</p><p>Outraged industry stakeholders had called for the overall Globes voting body to be closer to 300. Other reforms are aimed at battling the perception of influence peddling.</p><p>As eventual paid employees, members will be subject to firing without cause. They're now required to sign a code of conduct every year covering job performance, decorum and ethical behavior.</p><p>The 80-year-old group had been stuck in its ways, Hoehne acknowledged.</p><p>“We needed to question a lot of things. We needed to look at these bylaws and say, OK, how can we make them better? How can we modernize the association? We had never really done it and not addressed it,” she said.</p><div id="01abf66739ec4ad29949734e8a88118a" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Although the new pay structure has not yet been implemented, over the past year the HFPA has pushed out several members it accused of violating its standards.</p><p>One was accused of forging signatures on Internal Revenue Service documents, another case related to sexual harassment and a third involved fabricating interviews that never occurred, according to an HFPA spokesperson.</p><p>Boehly himself acknowledged the future is uncertain.</p><p>“I have nightmares where it doesn’t work too, you know? I get it, you can’t convince all of the people all of the time of anything,” he told the LA Times. “We know we have to add value and we know that we have to be part of the solution.”</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press Writer Krysta Fauria contributed to this report. </p><p>___</p><p>Follow Leanne Italie on Twitter at http://twitter.com/litalie</p>]]></description>

Drugstore chains are still trying to find enough employees to put a stop to temporary pharmacy closures. (AP Photo/Chris Carlson)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>Joan Cohrs missed her chance to grab a prescription at her usual drugstore by about 30 seconds.</p><p>Cohrs walked up to the counter of an Indianapolis CVS pharmacy shortly after a metal curtain descended, closing it for lunch. She didn't mind. The 60-year-old said she feels compassion for people in health care.</p><p>“They definitely need a break,” said Cohrs, who was working at an assisted living facility when COVID-19 hit.</p><p>A rush of vaccines, virus tests and a busy flu season started overwhelming pharmacies more than a year ago, forcing many to temporarily close when workers weren't available. </p><p>Major drugstore chains have raised pay and dangled signing bonuses to add employees. They’re also emphasizing the lunch breaks and sending routine prescription work to other locations to improve conditions in their pandemic-battered pharmacies.</p><p>Still, temporary closures persist, and experts say bigger changes are needed.</p><p>“There isn’t a shortage of pharmacists. There’s just a shortage of pharmacists who want to work in those high-stress environments that aren’t adequately resourced,” said Richard Dang, an assistant professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of Southern California.</p><p>Drugstores rely on pharmacists and pharmacy technicians to fill prescriptions, answer phones, work the drive-thru window, administer vaccines and give tests.</p><div id="afs:Card:029281580227" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="7aa39f8227449cc3b4e1bd2d3b130716">Hub peek embed (apf-Health) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>They also ask them to manage a growing amount of patient health. Pharmacists in many stores now help people quit smoking and monitor their blood sugar. And companies like Walgreens are pushing them to work more with primary care doctors. </p><p>Pharmacists also can now test for COVID-19 and then prescribe medicine, a process that might take 20 minutes or more.</p><p>Giving pharmacists a chance to have a bigger impact on public health is “awesome,” said Stefanie Ferreri, a University of North Carolina pharmacy professor. But she added that “the workforce wasn’t quite ready.”</p><p>Pharmacies, like other businesses, were hurt earlier in the pandemic because employees who got COVID-19 — or those in close contact with someone who did — had to miss work for a few days. Stress also left many pharmacists and technicians feeling burned out and looking for other jobs, industry observers say. </p><p>The number of job postings for retail pharmacists rose 63% from 2020 to 2021, according to the Pharmacy Workforce Center, a non-profit that tracks openings.</p><p>Walgreens leaders said Thursday that they added a net total of 600 pharmacists in the recently completed fiscal first quarter. But staff shortages still force the chain to reduce hours at some pharmacies.</p><p>A company representative decline to elaborate, calling it a fluid situation.</p><p>In addition to employee shortages, drugstores also are dealing with thin prescription reimbursement. That makes it hard to raise pay to compete for employees, said Douglas Hoey, CEO of the National Community Pharmacists Association.</p><p>“When just about everything goes up in price, pharmacies are still getting paid as if it was 2019 or 2018,” he said.</p><p>Walgreens is opening processing centers to help fill some of the routine prescriptions that stores get from patients with chronic conditions. Company leaders expect these centers to eventually take over about half the prescription volume from their stores.</p><p>The company also said in October it would eliminate all “task-based" measurements that are part of performance reviews for pharmacy employees.</p><p>CVS Health is trying to spread data entry and prescription verification work to different locations to ease the load at busy stores. </p><p>The company also started emphasizing the half-hour lunch breaks in February.</p><p>Those have limited value, according to Bled Tanoe, a former Walgreens pharmacist in Oklahoma City. She said customers often arrive just before the pharmacy closes, eating into the break time. </p><p>And store employees frequently catch up on work during that break.</p><p>Tanoe, 35, said she left drugstores in 2021 to work at a hospital because the demands were getting “impossible.” She and others say bolder steps are needed to improve the pharmacies. Pharmacists should have the ability to temporarily close counters or cancel some vaccination appointments when workloads get overwhelming, Tanoe said.</p><p>“A pharmacist whose license is on the line has to be the one to navigate and to dictate what is happening in the pharmacy on a daily function,” she said.</p><p>Dang noted that a relatively new California law prevents chain drugstores from establishing quotas for how many prescriptions a pharmacist must fill during a shift. </p><p>He also said drugstores simply need more employees behind the counter if they add services. He noted that the bigger chains are more prone to running drugstores with only one pharmacist.</p><p>At least one has to be on duty for a pharmacy to operate.</p><p>Ferreri would like to see more drugstores set appointments for regulars. That gives pharmacists predictable workloads and more time to fill and check prescriptions. It also reduces trips for customers and can help them keep track of refills. </p><p>These appointments ease stress, said Jessi Stout, owner of Table Rock Pharmacy in Morganton, North Carolina.</p><p>“It’s not like the patient’s in, waiting for you to fill 15 prescriptions at once,” she said.</p><p>One of Stout’s regulars, Debra Bowles, calls the free program “priceless.”</p><p>She refills about six prescriptions every month and has her mom enrolled in a similar program at another pharmacy. </p><p>“It makes taking care of people who cannot take care of themselves much easier,” the 65-year-old said. </p><p>While some pharmacies are changing how they operate, customers also can help. Ferreri recommends giving drugstores a few days to refill a prescription instead of waiting until the last pill. </p><p>Patience also is needed, said Brigid Groves, an executive with the American Pharmacists Association. She said they hear more about customers taking out their frustrations on pharmacy employees over delays or medicine shortages.</p><p>“I think on both sides of the counter, we need to all have grace and realize this is a very challenging and stressful time for everyone,” she said.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

(Jan. 6)</p>    <p>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — A Virginia teacher who was critically injured when she was was shot by a 6-year-old student in Newport News is showing signs of improvement as authorities struggle to understand how a child so young could be involved in a school shooting, the city's mayor said Saturday.</p><p>Newport News Mayor Phillip Jones said the condition of the teacher, a woman in her 30s, is “trending in a positive direction” as she remains hospitalized. Police Chief Steve Drew met with the teacher and her family Saturday morning. “She has improved and is currently listed in stable condition,” police said in a news release.</p><p>The boy shot and wounded the teacher with a handgun in a first-grade classroom on Friday at Richneck Elementary School, according to authorities. Drew said the shooting was not accidental and was part of an altercation. No students were injured. </p><p>Police on Saturday declined to describe what led to the altercation or any other details about what happened in the classroom, citing the ongoing investigation. </p><p>Jones also declined to reveal details of the shooting, or say how the boy got access to the gun or who owns the weapon.</p><p>“This is a red flag for the country," Jones said.</p><p>“I do think that after this event, there is going to be a nationwide discussion on how these sorts of things can be prevented.”</p><div id="afs:Card:849493086589" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="38beb789647975e2f8f0d7c7447eb777">Hub peek embed (Education) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Virginia law does not allow 6-year-olds to be tried as adults. In addition, a 6-year-old is too young to be committed to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice if found guilty.</p><p>A juvenile judge would have authority, though, to revoke a parent’s custody and place a child under the purview of the Department of Social Services. </p><p>Jones would not say where the boy is being held.</p><p>“We are ensuring he has all the services that he currently needs right now,” Jones said.</p><p>Experts who study gun violence said the shooting represents an extremely rare occurrence of a young child bringing a gun into school and wounding a teacher.</p><p>“It’s very rare and it’s not something the legal system is really designed or positioned to deal with,” said researcher David Riedman, founder of a <a href="https://k12ssdb.org/">database</a> that tracks U.S. school shootings dating back to 1970. </p><div id="01b0c7cd2d6543bf8177586dcc33f072" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>He said Saturday that he’s only aware of three other shootings caused by 6-year-old students in the time period he's studied. Those include the fatal shooting of a fellow student in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/e4d184e6ebb0d5859636d05963c2daba">2000 in Michigan</a> and shootings that injured other students in 2011 in Texas and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mississippi-jackson-shootings-5f73a9b46081cf14650e0ec2f3bc065c">2021 in Mississippi. </a></p><p>Riedman said he only knows of one other instance of a student younger than that causing gunfire at a school, in which a 5-year-old student brought a gun to a Tennessee school in 2013 and accidentally discharged it. No one was injured in that case. </p><p>Daniel W. Webster, a professor at Johns Hopkins University who studies gun violence, agreed that a 6-year-old shooting a teacher at school is extremely unusual. But he said his research shows that instances of young children accessing loaded guns and shooting themselves or others unintentionally in homes or other settings are rising. </p><p>“A 6 year old gaining access to a loaded gun and shooting him/herself or someone else, sadly, is not so rare,” he said in an email. </p><p>In the Newport News case, Drew said Friday that the shooting didn't appear to be an accident and that it was isolated to the single victim. He said the student and teacher had known each other in a classroom setting.</p><p>“We did not have a situation where someone was going around the school shooting,” Drew told reporters.</p><p>Investigators were trying to figure out where he obtained the handgun. </p><p>Parents and students were reunited at a gymnasium, Newport News Public Schools said via Facebook.</p><p>The police chief declined to discuss what contact investigators have had with the boy's parents.</p><p>“We have been in contact with our commonwealth’s attorney (local prosecutor) and some other entities to help us best get services to this young man,” Drew said. </p><p>Newport News is a city of about 185,000 people in southeastern Virginia known for its shipyard, which builds the nation's aircraft carriers and other U.S. Navy vessels. </p><p>Richneck has about 550 students who are in kindergarten through fifth grade, according to the Virginia Department of Education’s website. Jones said there will be no classes at the school Monday and Tuesday. </p><p>“Today our students got a lesson in gun violence,” said George Parker III, Newport News schools superintendent, “and what guns can do to disrupt, not only an educational environment, but also a family, a community.” </p><p>___ Associated Press writers Ben Finley in Norfolk, Matthew Barakat in Falls Church and Ed White in Detroit contributed to this report. </p>]]></description>

(Harry: The Interview on ITV1 and ITVX at 9pm on January 8/PA via AP)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>LONDON (AP) — Allies of Britain’s royal family pushed back Saturday against claims made by Prince Harry in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/prince-harry-book-details-ce879703cbc92372e4736313c6cab941">his new memoir,</a> which paints the monarchy as a cold and callous institution that failed to nurture or support him.</p><p>Buckingham Palace hasn't officially commented on the book. But British newspapers and websites brimmed with quotes from unnamed "royal insiders,” rebutting Harry’s accusations. One said his public attacks on the royal family took a “toll” on the health of Queen Elizabeth II, who died in September.</p><p>Veteran journalist Jonathan Dimbleby, a biographer and friend of King Charles III, said Harry’s revelations were the type “that you’d expect … from a sort of B-list celebrity,” and that the king would be pained and frustrated by them.</p><p>“His concern … is to act as head of state for a nation which we all know is in pretty troubled condition,” Dimbleby told the BBC. “I think he will think this gets in the way.“</p><p>Harry’s book, “Spare,” is the latest in a string of very public pronouncements by the prince and his wife Meghan since they <a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-canada-entertainment-celebrities-queen-elizabeth-ii-8cb152f4cdd09fc7d312d86c7e704b87">quit royal life</a> and moved to California in 2020, citing what they saw as the media’s racist treatment of Meghan, who is biracial, and a lack of support from the palace. It follows an interview with Oprah Winfrey and a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/king-charles-iii-entertainment-london-meghan-markle-prince-harry-7d92f6e8db06b2694a386eac01cfd38c">six-part Netflix documentary</a> released last month.</p><div id="afs:Card:930858951867" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="952c0cbaa0c39d18b8338ca651b49394">Hub peek embed (QueenElizabethII) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Harry is not the first British royal to air family secrets — both his parents used the media as their marriage fell apart. Charles cooperated on Dimbleby’s 1994 book and accompanying television documentary, which revealed that the then heir to the throne had had an affair during his marriage to Princess Diana.</p><p>Diana gave her side of the story in a BBC interview the following year, famously saying “there were three of us in this marriage” in reference to Charles’ relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles.</p><p>But “Spare” goes into far more detail about private conversations and personal grievances than any previous royal revelation. </p><p>In the ghostwritten memoir, Harry discusses his grief at the death of his mother in 1997 and his long-simmering resentment at the role of royal “spare,” overshadowed by the “heir” — older brother Prince William. He recounts arguments and a physical altercation with William, reveals how he lost his virginity (in a field) and describes using cocaine and cannabis.</p><p>He also says he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/prince-harry-afghanistan-service-claims-1c497d35a8211dc0366429856a539e2a">killed 25 Taliban fighters</a> while serving as an Apache helicopter pilot in Afghanistan — a claim criticized by both the Taliban and British military veterans.</p><p>“Spare” is due to be published around the world on Tuesday. The Associated Press obtained an early Spanish-language copy.</p><p>Harry has said he expects counterattacks from the palace. He has long complained of “leaks” and “plants” of stories to the media by members of the royal household.</p><p>In an interview due to be broadcast on ITV on Sunday — one of several he has recorded to promote the book — Harry says people who accuse him of invading his family’s privacy “don’t understand or don’t want to believe that my family have been briefing the press.”</p><p>“I don’t know how staying silent is ever going to make things better,” he said.</p>]]></description>

(Amelia Ferrell Knisely via AP)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — A West Virginia journalist lost her job last month after she reported about alleged abuse of people with disabilities within the state agency that runs West Virginia's foster care and psychiatric facilities.</p><p>Amelia Ferrell Knisely, a reporter at West Virginia Public Broadcasting, said she was told to stop reporting on the Department of Health and Human Resources after leaders of the embattled agency “threatened to discredit” the publicly funded television and radio network. She later learned her part-time position was being eliminated.</p><p>In a statement, Knisely said her news director told her the order came from WVPB Executive Director Butch Antolini, former communications director for Republican Gov. Jim Justice. Antolini has served as executive director since 2021, when his predecessor was ousted after Justice overhauled the agency’s governing board. </p><p>Justice has tried unsuccessfully to eliminate state funding for WVPB in the past and was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-government-and-politics-5cabaac7d932d3eb85151c006a11d584">accused of appointing partisan operatives</a> to the board. WVPB receives around $4 million a year in state funding.</p><p>Antolini declined to comment, but other officials denied any effort to influence coverage. West Virginia Educational Broadcasting Authority chairman William H. File III said Antolini told the board “he was not coerced or pressured by anyone."</p><div id="afs:Card:537099677172" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="af942f587d098b2d996cc6e01991d615">Hub peek embed (WestVirginia) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>File said in a statement that Knisely was never fired and remains on the WVPB payroll, though she said her door key and email were deactivated.</p><p>Knisely’s departure comes during a tumultuous time for West Virginia media. Days before she left WVPB, three reporters for the Pulitzer Prize-winning Charleston Gazette-Mail said they were fired after <a href="https://apnews.com/article/twitter-inc-business-west-virginia-charleston-don-blankenship-9c16926c55e137ee7345e38f7fbf2ae9">publicly criticizing an editorial decision</a> by their company president Doug Skaff, who is minority leader in the state House of Delegates. Skaff approved and led a video interview with Don Blankenship, a coal company executive convicted of safety violations connected to one of the worst coal mining disasters in recent U.S. history.</p><p>The departures leave a diminished capitol press corps to cover the upcoming legislative session, which begins Jan. 11. </p><p>Knisely’s stories detailed alleged mistreatment of people with disabilities under state care. The department cares for some of the most vulnerable residents in one of the poorest U.S. states.</p><p>After Knisely’s departure from WVPB was first reported by <a href="https://www.weirtondailytimes.com/news/local-news/2022/12/public-broadcasting-reporter-released-after-dhhr-pressure/">The Parkersburg News and Sentinel</a> last week, both Republican Senate President Craig Blair and Democratic Party Chair Mike Pushkin called the circumstances around her departure “disturbing.” </p><p>Pushkin said Knisely’s coverage of “the glaring issues at DHHR” was “detailed, in depth, and most importantly true.”</p><p>“There’s a very clear difference between not liking what the media reports and actively working to silence them,” Blair wrote on Twitter Dec. 29. </p><p>Knisely was hired as a part-time reporter at WVPB in September. In November, she was copied on an email from then-DHHR Secretary Bill Crouch alleging inaccuracies in a story and asking for a “complete retraction.” </p><p>That never happened, but in early December, Knisely said she was told by WVPB news director Eric Douglas that she could no longer cover DHHR because of threats by state officials to discredit WVPB. </p><p>A week later, amid mounting criticism, Crouch announced he was resigning. </p><p>Douglas confirmed to The Associated Press that he was instructed to tell Knisely she would no longer be reporting on DHHR, and that Antolini directed him to do so. </p><p>As for threats from DHHR officials about discrediting WVPB, he said: “I’d rather not comment on that.” </p><p>On Dec. 15, Knisely filed a human resources complaint about interference with her reporting.</p><p>Things came to a head later that same day over Knisely's press credentials for the 2023 legislative session, according to emails obtained by the AP and first reported by <a href="https://www.weirtondailytimes.com/news/local-news/2022/12/public-broadcasting-reporter-released-after-dhhr-pressure/">The Parkersburg News and Sentinel</a>. </p><p>Douglas initially informed legislative staffers that Knisely would “serve a vital role" in WVPB's 2023 legislative coverage. But then the station's chief operating officer left him off an email saying she wouldn't need credentials after all.</p><p>That troubled Senate spokesperson Jacque Bland, who emailed Douglas to ask about it.</p><p>“It feels kind of gross and shady to me that someone else would dip in and say that one of your reporters won’t have any assignments related to the session,” she wrote.</p><p>She added: “I definitely wanted you to be aware that Butch and Pals were trying to stick their fingers in the pie.”</p><p>Responding the next day, Douglas said he had been pulled into Antolini’s office and told “things had changed with Amelia.” He said he didn’t appreciate WVPB leadership going behind his back, “but for now it is out of my hands.”</p><p>“And you’re right, it does feel gross and shady,” he wrote.</p><p>Knisely said she was informed Dec. 20 that part-time positions were being eliminated. Her email and key card were deactivated around that time. </p><p>This week, Knisely announced on Twitter she was hired by the Beckley-based newspaper The Register-Herald to report on West Virginia's upcoming legislative session. Her coverage will include developments with the state Department of Health and Human Resources, she said. </p>]]></description>

And for the first time in the 31 years of Ukraine’s independence, the service there was held in the Ukrainian language. Ukrainian army troops in uniform were among those singing well-known Ukrainian carols.</p><p>Ukraine's government on Thursday <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-government-moscow-religion-orthodox-church-edafd7fef7f0d12e692a30e56a05ed1b">took over</a> the administration of the Dormition Cathedral at the Kyiv-Pechersk monastery and allowed the Orthodox Church of Ukraine to use it for the Orthodox Christmas service. The move highlights the long-running tensions between the two churches exacerbated by <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine">Russia’s war in Ukraine</a>.</p><p>The cathedral. built about 1,000 years ago then rebuilt in the 1990s after being ruined in World War II, had been under control of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which formerly had ties with the Russian Orthodox Church. </p><div id="afs:Card:521103274690" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="9bea8791e5eda36a0b01cb3b6da86bd5">Hub peek embed (Russia-Ukraine) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“It’s a first victory” for Ukraine, said Oksana Abu-Akel who hailed it as a significant step for Orthodox believers to cut ties with Russia after it started the war more than 10 months ago. “This is the first time in 300 years that there is really our own service here. Every person feels this joy. It is a victory for all Ukrainians.”</p><p>Ukrainian Culture Minister Oleksandr Tkachenko said Thursday that the cathedral had been taken over by the state after the lease of the Moscow-affiliated church expired on Dec. 31. Tkachenko attended the service Saturday.</p><p>“It’s an amazing moment. Previously this place — on Ukrainian territory, within Kyiv — has been linked to Moscow. Now we feel this is ours, this is Ukrainian. This is part of the Ukrainian nation,” said Alex Fesiak, who attended the service. </p><p>In 2019, the Orthodox Church of Ukraine received recognition from the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. Moscow’s and most other Orthodox patriarchs refused to accept that designation that formalized a split with the Russian church. </p><p>The Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC), which remained loyal to the Moscow patriarch since the 17th century, declared independence from Moscow’s Patriarchate after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The UOC gave Moscow a liturgical cold shoulder by dropping the commemoration of Moscow Patriarch Kirill as its leader in public worship and blessing its own sacramental oil rather than use Moscow’s supply. </p><p>Metropolitan Epiphanius, the primate of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, spoke not just about Christmas but delivered a political message about the war.</p><p>“As a nation, we sought to live peacefully, having a good understanding with all our neighbors. But the enemy meanly and treacherously broke the peace and invaded our land, shedding blood, sowing death and wanting to destroy our statehood and our very Ukrainian identity,” he said during the service.</p><p>“Those who held us in captivity could not endure our achievements and our success," he said. "The devil’s malice and envy prompted them to make war, but they are sure to be defeated. After all, the truth is on our side.”</p><p>Natalia Levshyna said her husband couldn’t come to the Christmas service as he is fighting on the front line, but she will send him photos of the service as it's very important to him. Originally from Donbas, she said she stopped attending the church of the Moscow Patriarchate in 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula and supported the conflict in the eastern part of Ukraine.</p><p>"Our emotions are running high,” she said, barely holding back tears, describing her conviction that the Ukrainian church on Ukrainian soil should be independent from the Russian Orthodox Church.</p><p>“Our church must be synchronized with state policy. They must be one,” Levshyna said.</p><p>Others in Ukraine have decided to distance themselves from the Russian Orthodox Church <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-religion-orthodox-church-c8b84fad9dfe93554b2d28b08ec21ada">by celebrating Christmas on Dec. 25. </a></p><p>On Friday, the Church of Moscow Patriarchate condemned the Ukrainian plans to hold a service in the Kyiv cathedral as ”an attempt to forcefully seize ... the cathedral by means of blackmail and misinformation of society.”</p><p>In 2019, the Orthodox Church of Ukraine received recognition from the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, but the Moscow’s patriarch refused to accept that.</p><p>The Ukrainian Orthodox Church declared independence from Moscow’s Patriarchate after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, ending the Ukrainian church's loyalty to the Moscow patriarch which dated back to the 17th century. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church removed Moscow Patriarch Kirill as its leader in public worship and now uses its own sacramental oil for blessings rather than oil supplied by Moscow.</p><p>But Ukrainian security agencies <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-europe-religion-moscow-522129139cfa46c7da0dc0fe3d28f6cb">have claimed</a> that some in the Ukrainian church have maintained close ties with Moscow. They've raided numerous holy sites of the church and later posted photos of rubles, Russian passports and leaflets with messages from the Moscow patriarch as proof that some church officials have been loyal to Moscow.</p><p>Prominent Ukrainian Orthodox Church leaders have rejected the allegations of ties with Moscow, insisting that they have loyally supported Ukraine from the start of the war and that a government crackdown will only hand a propaganda coup to Russia.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine">https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine</a></p><p>___</p><p>This story has been corrected to show that the cathedral was taken over, not the monastery complex, and that the church is Moscow-affiliated, not Moscow-controlled.</p>]]></description>

In Mexico, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's security forces nabbed one of the sons of imprisoned former Sinaloa cartel boss <a href="https://apnews.com/article/latin-america-ap-top-news-us-news-new-york-courts-2b16e1b751b044f3a7581df96ed41ef3">Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán</a>, touching off violence that left 30 dead and dozens injured. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/Ovidio-Guzman-arrested-24bca5ce8544bc151e6c821a37b2be41">The son, Ovidio Guzmán, is a reputed drug trafficker wanted by the United States.</a></p><p>The two presidents, along with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, will gather in Mexico City on Monday and Tuesday for a North American leaders summit. Even with progress on the migration issue, there is much to discuss: climate change, manufacturing, trade, the economy and the potential global clout of a more collaborative North America. </p><p>Biden arrives at the Palacio Nacional in Mexico City on Monday afternoon and the presidents will meet before Trudeau joins them for dinner. Biden and Trudeau will hold talks Tuesday and then the three will gather for discussions. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/b8d2682265be41d7aed559afebaf6c9f">It will be the first time since 2014</a> that Mexico has hosted a U.S. president. </p><div id="afs:Card:130243251955" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="599d640834d079503c5dd568c312c19f">Hub peek embed (JoeBiden) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Biden hopes to use the summit "to keep driving North America's economic competitiveness and help promote inclusive growth and prosperity,” said National Security Council spokesman John Kirby. </p><p>For the U.S., the major talking points are migration, drug trafficking and building on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-technology-business-nevada-environment-and-nature-630a11b14d738335d9d336bc9b51be8e">Biden's push on electric vehicles and manufacturing. </a></p><p>Lopez Obrador is focused on economic integration for North America, supporting the poor in the Americas and regional relationships that put all governments on equal footing.</p><p>The U.S. and Mexico are expected to continue discussions about ending a dispute over U.S. corn after <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-business-mexico-city-general-motors-co-c0df384e0eb07a458ce78f9df28f1bf3">Mexico announced it would ban imports of genetically modified corn.</a> In addition, Mexico is seeking money to boost solar energy projects. </p><p>As for Canada, the goal is simply "to carve some attention and space in this summit,” said Louise Blais, a longtime Canadian diplomat. </p><p>Mexico sees the event as a chance to advance its economic interests. </p><p>It stands to benefit as U.S. companies reconsider their relationships with China after supply chain disruptions, coronavirus outbreaks and changes in federal policy. Both Mexico’s proximity to the U.S. and existing trade agreements would be incentives for American factories to relocate south of the border. The U.S. imported more than $380 billion worth of goods from Mexico through the first 10 months of 2022 — the third-largest source of imports after China and the European Union, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p><p>Canada is the fourth-largest U.S. partner by imports, with the State Department calling it “the world’s most comprehensive trading relationship.” The U.S. and Canada are each other’s largest market for exports, and Canada is the largest foreign supplier of energy products to the U.S.</p><p>The U.S., Mexico and Canada are already in a long-standing trade agreement that was updated in 2020. When U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai met last month with Mexico’s secretary of the economy, Raquel Buenrostro, they discussed further economic integration as well as energy, fisheries and the trade agreement’s ban on importing goods made by forced labor — a subject that is among the tensions with China.</p><p>Analysts at Bank of America estimated in October that Mexico could increase its trade by as much as 30% if more supply chains returned to North America. Their report notes there had already been a bump in Mexican manufacturing as U.S. policymakers and businesses increasingly focus on bringing more trade to allied countries that are near American consumers.</p><p>“Every country is arriving with different priorities, but there is common ground,” said Enrique Perret, managing director of the U.S.-Mexico Foundation, a think tank focused on cooperation between the two nations. “It’s competitiveness, it’s economy, it’s education, it’s labor mobility.” </p><p>But it's not all rosy. </p><p>The leaders of Canada and Mexico have voiced concerns over Biden's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/25/president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-strengthening-buy-american-provisions-ensuring-future-of-america-is-made-in-america-by-all-of-americas-workers/">“Buy America” plan</a>. And while Biden's push toward electric vehicles is a boon to both nations because of the tax credits for North American batteries, there's concern the U.S. allies will be left behind. </p><p>Meantime, the U.S. and Canada accuse López Obrador of trying to favor Mexico’s state-owned utility over power plants built by foreign and private investors, something that is forbidden under the three countries' free trade pact.</p><p>The leaders did meet in Washington last November, but until then, there hadn't been a summit in five years and many of the current disputes have festered despite constant discussion. They include fentanyl trafficking, corn production, automobile rules of origin and Mexican energy laws.</p><p>"These topics are really complicated issues and they will not be solved in a two-day summit," said Carin Zissis of the Americas Society, a nonprofit dedicated to education, debate and dialogue in the Americas. </p><p>The chemistry between Biden and Lopez Obrador is tricky, too. Their relationship is highly transactional and absent any of the warmth and camaraderie Biden has with other world leaders.</p><p>Lopez Obrador has made no secret of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-international-news-global-trade-virus-outbreak-fc583a27741c9d4be4d3b2933cf0ae57">his admiration of Biden's predecessor</a>, Donald Trump. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-caribbean-united-states-electoral-college-mexico-74cf00fdbe55703629bee9f47aac660a">Lopez Obrador did not recognize Biden’s election victory</a> from November 2020 until after the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-270-electoral-college-vote-d429ef97af2bf574d16463384dc7cc1e">formal Electoral College vote</a> a month later.</p><p>Biden has raised concerns over security and drug trafficking in Mexico and the deaths of journalists there. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-covid-politics-health-6efb4c2bde5d080a9ee400a0981f7a61">The U.S. took issue with Lopez Obrador for boycotting</a> the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles last year over Biden's decision not to invite the leaders of Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. </p><p>Biden plans to stop in El Paso, Texas, on Sunday for his first visit as president to the U.S.-Mexico border, just days after announcing that the U.S. will immediately begin turning away Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans who illegally cross into the U.S. from Mexico. The new policy is an effort to manage the spiraling numbers of migrants arriving at the border. </p><p>Mexico agreed each month to take 30,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans and Haitians who walk or swim to the U.S. and are turned back, and the U.S. each month will offer 30,000 people from those four nations work permits for two years and a legal path if they come to the U.S. by plane, have eligible sponsors and pass background checks. People from those four countries now make up the most migrants crossing the border. </p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-mexico-immigration-covid-93d735b9b55c15121c8fc7763fba7e78">Biden's attempt to tackle border security issues</a> has drawn considerable criticism from immigrant advocates and refugee rights groups ,who say the changes are inhumane and reminiscent of Trump's hard-line approach.</p><p>___</p><p>Verza reported from Mexico City.

People who got the drug still worsened but not as rapidly as those given dummy versions — a difference of nearly half a point on that scale by the study's end.</p><p>Experts are divided over how meaningful a benefit that is. It may be hard for families to tell if a loved one's decline has slowed, Gandy said.</p><p>Other experts say slowing the disease early on, when people still function well, is important even if it's not that easy to spot.</p><div id="7c7ceed2303c4d01ba843498ccb583d9" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>“Several months with better cognition, what’s that worth to you?” Hodes asked. “I think there you can get a strong argument: If I can interact with my family, be independent for months ... that’s a very meaningful outcome.”</p><p>WHAT ARE THE RISKS?</p><p>Like other amyloid-targeting medications, Leqembi can cause brain swelling or small brain bleeds. In Eisai's study, 13% of drug recipients had swelling and 17% has small brain bleeds. </p><p>The likely reason: Amyloid plaques usually form around nerve cells in the brain but sometimes the gunk gets inside blood vessels, too. Pulling amyloid out of those blood vessels can weaken them, making them leaky, Gandy explained.</p><p>While the brain swelling and bleeds may cause only minimal symptoms such as dizziness and vision problems, they occasionally can be severe — and several Leqembi users have died while taking the drug, including two who were on blood-thinning medications. </p><p>Eisai has said the deaths can't be attributed to its Alzheimer's drug. But Gandy said the greatest risk of serious bleeding would be among Leqembi users who also take blood thinners, which are commonly used by older adults to prevent or treat strokes.</p><p>Patients also may experience temporary reactions after the infusions that can include fever, flu-like chills, nausea and blood pressure fluctuations.</p><p>WHO IS ELIGIBLE?</p><p>The drug is only intended for people in the very early stages of Alzheimer's who also have that tell-tale amyloid buildup. </p><p>The FDA warned doctors to use caution if they prescribe Leqembi to people who use blood thinners. Patients also will be urged to get brain scans several times over the course of treatment. </p><p>As patients gradually worsen, it's not clear how long they should continue getting the twice-a-month IV infusions. Study participants are being tracked for longer periods, and other research is exploring even earlier use — before people with amyloid buildup show symptoms.</p><p>WHEN WILL IT BE AVAILABLE?</p><p>Eisai says the drug should be available by Jan. 23, but most patients will likely have to wait months to get it.</p><p>That’s because health insurers are expected to scrutinize the drug’s effectiveness before deciding whether to cover it, for which patients, and what testing they may require to confirm they are good candidates.</p><p>And Medicare, which covers most people with Alzheimer’s, is not expected to pay for the drug until later this year. That’s because the plan for seniors only pays for Alzheimer’s drugs that have received full approval from the FDA — while the agency granted Leqembi's approval using a shortcut based on preliminary study results. The FDA is set to review that larger 18-month study soon, in anticipation of full approval later this year.</p><p>HOW MUCH WILL THE DRUG COST?</p><p>The IV drug will cost about $26,500 for a typical year’s worth of treatment. If insurers cover it, most people won't pay anywhere near that much — although people with insurance that requires them to shoulder a larger portion of their drug costs could pay thousands a year.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Greg Abbott</a> that ordered child welfare agents to open abuse investigations into parents who let their children receive gender-affirming care.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>In Tennessee, the GOP-controlled legislature announced after Election Day that its first priority would be to ban medical providers from altering a child’s hormones or performing surgeries that enable them to present as a gender different from their sex. The <a href="https://www.billtrack50.com/billdetail/1496311">pre-filed bill</a> would replace present law with more stringent restrictions.</p><p>The World Professional Association for Transgender Health said last year that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/gender-transition-treatment-guidelines-9dbe54f670a3a0f5f2831c2bf14f9bbb">teens experiencing gender dysphoria</a> can start taking hormones at age 14 and can have certain surgeries at ages 15 or 17. The group acknowledged potential risks but said it was unethical to withhold early treatments, which can improve psychological well-being and reduce suicide risk.</p><p>Legislation pre-filed this week in Republican-controlled Oklahoma, which passed restrictions last year on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sports-oklahoma-oklahoma-city-819e04ae365373b69d8706a6c803dbf7">trans participation in sports</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-oklahoma-b19f921843bfddc0a71b8332946674f7">school bathroom usage</a>, seeks to ban gender-affirming care for patients <a href="https://legiscan.com/OK/text/SB129/2023">under age 26</a> and block it from being covered under the state’s Medicaid program. </p><p>“This is the worst anti-trans bill I have ever seen filed in any state,” Reed said, noting that adult medical transition bans were a “hypothetical escalation” until recently.</p><p>Another Oklahoma proposal would <a href="https://legiscan.com/OK/text/HB1011/2023">prohibit distribution of public funds</a> to organizations that provide gender-affirming procedures to patients younger than 21.</p><p>“It’s irresponsible for anybody in health care to provide or recommend life-altering surgeries that may later be regretted,” said the bill's sponsor, Republican state Rep. Jim Olsen. “Performing irreversible procedures on young people can do irreparable harm to them mentally and physically later in life.”</p><p>A similar bill pre-filed in South Carolina, where Republicans control both chambers, also requires that <a href="https://legiscan.com/SC/text/S0274/2023">trans adults older than 21 obtain referrals</a> from their doctor and a licensed psychiatrist before they can begin treatment.</p><p>Cathy Renna, spokesperson for the National LGBTQ Task Force, said she views these bills as the product of “a permissible climate of hate," driven by disinformation and fearmongering, that made anti-LGBTQ rhetoric more palatable in the years since former President Donald Trump's election in 2016. </p><p>“We have politicians, celebrities and just folks in our communities who were given permission under Trump to kind of pick that scab and do and say harmful things without consequence,” Renna said. “It unleashed a nightmare Pandora’s box of sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, antisemitism.”</p><p>“When you look at the last few years," she said of the LGBTQ community, "we feel like we’re under attack in a way that we have not for decades.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Democrats in some states are taking a more aggressive approach to transgender health protections.</p><p>A new California law, effective as of Jan. 1, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-gender-identity-sacramento-gavin-newsom-1bef273ba60e61a17960eaf8107f37f6">shields families of transgender youth from criminal prosecution</a> if they travel to California for gender-affirming health procedures, such as surgeries or hormone therapy, from states that ban such treatments for minors. Making California a refuge for trans youth and their parents, the law blocks out-of-state subpoenas and prohibits medical providers from sharing information on gender-affirming care with out-of-state entities.</p><p>Another <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB36">California bill</a>, filed in December, would expand those protections by prohibiting a magistrate from issuing an arrest warrant for violating another state’s law that criminalizes helping someone obtain an abortion or gender-affirming care.</p><p>An Illinois lawmaker introduced a similar sanctuary <a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/102/SB/PDF/10200SB4245lv.pdf">bill</a> late last year. The state <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-politics-health-illinois-7fc5b573737c4ac3e6caad21251e1f9b">House passed another bill Friday</a> to increase protections for patients and providers of abortions and gender-affirming treatments.</p><p>And in Minnesota, where <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-politics-minnesota-marijuana-gender-c20c29529364f5a64ee0d68eaf7055a5">Democrats gained a trifecta of state government control</a> in the midterm elections, a new <a href="https://legiscan.com/MN/text/SF63/2023">bill</a> would give the state jurisdiction in child custody cases involving parents who bring their children to Minnesota for gender-affirming health care.</p><p>Reed, a trans woman, is monitoring a growing list of other proposals across statehouses, including drag performance bans, bathroom usage restrictions, limits on LGBTQ discussions in schools and obstacles to changing the gender marker on a driver’s license or birth certificate. But the rising age minimums proposed to access gender-affirming care are among her chief concerns.</p><p>“Adult transition bans are coming into play, and I’m already hearing some talk of, ‘Well, the brain doesn’t finish developing until 25, so why not restrict it until then,’” she said. “Any further loss of autonomy is incredibly concerning.”</p><p>___</p><p>Hannah Schoenbaum, based in Raleigh, North Carolina, is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Ukrainian officials reported Russian shelling attacks in the Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions on Saturday. </p><p>Russia's Defense Ministry insisted Saturday that its forces along the 1,100-kilometer (684-mile) front line were observing the Kremlin-ordered truce, but returned fire when attacked. </p><p>The latest package of U.S. military assistance was the biggest to date for Ukraine. For the first time, it included 50 Bradley armored vehicles and 500 of the anti-tank missiles they can fire. Germany also <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-united-states-government-olaf-scholz-germany-84fc07af2356d8d02adec2e987d06c0a">announced it would supply</a> around 40 Marder armored personnel carriers and France promised <a href="https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-technology-france-government-ukraine-military-0ff505a3c710124e02b3a60becf147e2">wheeled AMX-10 RC tank destroyers.</a></p><div id="afs:Card:521103274690" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="9b3a132b330c90a10e8f031113be241b">Hub peek embed (Russia-Ukraine) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Together, this week's pledges were powerful signals that Ukraine can count on continued long-term Western aid against Russian President Vladimir Putin's drive to dismember the country.</p><p>In his nightly televised address on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed the U.S. aid package as “very powerful.”</p><p>“For the first time, we will get Bradley armored vehicles — this is exactly what is needed. New guns and rounds, including high-precision ones, new rockets, new drones. It is timely and strong,” he said.</p><p>He thanked U.S. President Joe Biden, U.S. lawmakers and “all the Americans who appreciate freedom, and who know that freedom is worth protecting.”</p><p>Celebrated by both Ukrainians and Russians, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/putin-ukraine-government-religion-e0d9f15655e18308c991997f7fc71cf7">the Orthodox Christmas holiday</a> also underscored the enmity that Russia's invasion is precipitating between them.</p><p>In a revered cathedral in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, the Christmas service Saturday was delivered in the Ukrainian language — instead of Russian — for the first time in decades, highlighting how Ukraine is seeking to jettison Moscow's remaining influences over religious, cultural and economic life in the country.</p><p>Ukraine’s government on Thursday took over administration of the Kyiv-Pechersk monastery's Dormition Cathedral from the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which had been loyal to the Russian Orthodox Church, and allowed the Ukrainian church to use it for the Christmas service.</p><p>The monastery complex is a UNESCO World Heritage site. The cathedral was built about 1,000 years ago, then reconstructed in the 1990s after being ruined in World War II. </p><p>“It’s an amazing moment," said Alex Fesiak, among hundreds of worshippers who attended. “Previously this place — on Ukrainian territory, within Kyiv — has been linked to Moscow. Now we feel this is ours, this is Ukrainian. This is part of the Ukrainian nation.” </p><p>The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kyiv-russia-ukraine-war-government-7a4df498707bb047d2a322005c861fd0">Putin-ordered Christmas cease-fire</a> that started Friday was first proposed by the Russian Orthodox Church's Kremlin-aligned head, Patriarch Kirill. The Orthodox Church uses the Julian calendar and celebrates Christmas on Jan. 7. Putin's order said a cease-fire would allow worshippers in combat zones to attend Christmas services. </p><p>But Ukrainian officials didn't commit to following it and dismissed the move as a Russian ploy to buy time for its struggling invasion forces to regroup. Ukrainian and Western officials portrayed the announcement as a Russian attempt to grab the moral high ground and possibly snatch battlefield initiative and momentum from Ukrainian forces amid their counteroffensive of recent months.</p><p>The pause was due to end Saturday night — at midnight Moscow time, which is 11 p.m. in Kyiv. </p><p>The Ministry of Defense in Britain, a leading supplier of military aid to Ukraine, said Saturday in its daily readout on the invasion that “fighting has continued at a routine level into the Orthodox Christmas period.” </p><p>In the fiercely contested Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine, regional Gov. Serhiy Haidai reported continued Russian shelling and assaults. Posting Friday on Telegram, Haidai said that in the first three hours of the cease-fire, Russian forces shelled Ukrainian positions 14 times and stormed one settlement three times. The claim couldn't be independently verified.</p><p>Ukrainian authorities on Saturday also reported attacks elsewhere in the previous 24 hours although it wasn't clear whether the fighting was before or after the cease-fire's start. </p><p>The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said Russian forces carried out a missile strike and 20 salvos with rockets, and targeted settlements in the east, northeast and south.</p><p>The head of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region on Saturday reported two civilian deaths the previous day from Russian strikes in the fiercely contested city of Bakhmut and to its north, in Krasna Hora.</p><p>In the southern Kherson region, Gov. Yaroslav Yanushevych said Saturday that Russian forces shelled 39 times on Friday, hitting houses and apartment buildings, as well as a fire station.

(Jan. 7)</p>    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — It was the extraordinary moment that brought House Republicans to the brink — and ultimately the moment they found their way back.</p><p>Just one vote short of becoming speaker of the House, California <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-house-of-representatives-kevin-mccarthy-us-republican-party-0938c7358f41c83759246f8949ac7c15">Republican Kevin McCarthy</a> stood from his chair and walked down the center aisle to the back of the chamber. It was nearing midnight, and he had already lost 13 votes for speaker over four long days. The room fell almost silent as it became apparent that the GOP leader was now asking — begging, really — the bombastic, blustering, defiant Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz to change his vote from “present” to “McCarthy.”</p><p>Gaetz, who had hurled personal insults at McCarthy just hours earlier on the House floor, said no.</p><p>McCarthy slowly walked back down the aisle, alone, head tilted to the ground. But he turned back around when he heard a scuffle behind him. Alabama Rep. Mike Rogers, a Republican ally of McCarthy, had angrily confronted Gaetz, telling him he would regret his decision. Lawmakers on the floor yelled in disbelief as Rogers was held back by a colleague. </p><p>McCarthy walked back to make sure the argument was over and then returned to his chair, defeated. </p><p>He lost the 14th vote. Allies moved to abruptly adjourn the House, their hoped-for unity seemingly coming apart.</p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="f2a4a42b4845f2413cca5c1b4c6100dd">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Then tempers cooled. And within the hour, McCarthy and his allies had persuaded his other remaining opponents to vote “present” as well, lowering the vote total necessary for McCarthy to win and handing him the speakership by early Saturday morning — after a historic, remarkable and somewhat astonishing week of repeated votes.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“I hope one thing is clear,” McCarthy said when he finally took the gavel after 1 a.m. “I never give up.”</p><p>The chaos on the House floor came exactly two years after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection. During a late-night session after that attack, McCarthy called it the “saddest day I’ve ever had” as a member of Congress. In the days afterward, McCarthy blamed then-President Donald Trump for encouraging his supporters who attacked the building and interrupted the certification of President Joe Biden. But just a few weeks later McCarthy traveled to see Trump in Florida and made amends.</p><div id="5fcb4e62825e400c8fe0c1c0ba6396c0" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>The scene Friday was a different kind of chaos — but it was a full-circle moment for Republicans, who had ceded both chambers of Congress and the presidency to Democrats after the violent insurrection. While many of them denounced Trump at the time, McCarthy’s Florida visit brought him back into the fold, and the former president was working the phones Friday evening, calling Gaetz and the other holdouts.</p><p>“He was with me from the beginning,” McCarthy said after the final vote, noting Trump's phone calls as well.</p><p>While the U.S. House is often raucous, the week’s events were almost surreal: vote after vote, defeat after defeat, and eventual success after picking off seemingly intransigent opponents. </p><p>McCarthy needed two more votes going into the Friday evening tally, which didn’t start until 10 p.m., late enough to provide two of his supporters — one whose wife had given birth that week and another who was ill — time to return to Washington. McCarthy and his allies seemed confident walking in, but as the votes ticked off, it became clear he would be one short.</p><p>Two of McCarthy’s closest lieutenants, North Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry and Louisiana Rep. Garrett Graves, sat on either side of Gaetz during the vote, with Graves at one point on his knees. But Gaetz could only be partially swayed, and stood to say “present” when the roll call reached his name. It wasn’t enough, and McCarthy approached him just before the vote was called, C-SPAN cameras tracking his short journey.</p><p>Gaetz was angrily pointing at McCarthy during the conversation. But Colorado Rep. Ken Buck, a McCarthy supporter who was standing nearby, said the exchange between the two men was pleasant, and that McCarthy just asked him to change his vote. Gaetz said his “present” vote was as far as he was going, Buck said.</p><p>McCarthy said afterward that Gaetz eventually “got everybody there to the point that nobody voted against me,” persuading some of his fellow colleagues to vote “present” as well. In the end, no Republican voted against McCarthy.</p><p>They wanted to “make this conference united and work together,” McCarthy said.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Kevin Freking, Farnoush Amiri and Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report. </p>]]></description>

Braun/The Deseret News via AP)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>ENOCH, Utah (AP) — City leaders in a small Utah town choked up this week as they expressed shock after a murder-suicide carried out by a fellow church member left eight people dead in their close-knit community, including five children who were classmates with their kids. </p><p>Though shocking, family mass killings are an all-too-common tragedy across the country. They've happened nearly every 3.5 weeks for the last two decades on average, according to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mass-killing-index-dashboard-379385321413">a database</a> compiled by USA Today, The Associated Press and Northeastern University.</p><p>Enoch, Utah, is one of more than 30 communities sent reeling by a family mass killing in the last two years, a list that includes communities of wealth and poverty and spares no race or class. A family mass killing — where four or more people were killed, not including the perpetrator — happened each of the last two years in places as large as Houston or as small as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/casa-grande-8e7e270c261ad459a9407725e93faa97">Casa Grande, Arizona</a>, the database shows.</p><p>The circumstances of the killings are myriad: An argument over pandemic stimulus checks <a href="https://apnews.com/article/man-suspected-killing-4-over-stimulus-check-ba4df1d80d81be489dd3b5821cfd5df5">leaves</a> four family members shot dead and two injured in Indianapolis; <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fires-homicide-oklahoma-marilyn-nelson-ad5fc94b5ffa5cc3c1648a25dbe4f040">financial issues</a> lead to authorities finding six children and their parents inside a house set ablaze in Oklahoma; an escalating custody battle in Ohio precedes a man and members of his family shooting the mother of his child and seven of her family members; a father loses his job, piles his wife and kids in the family station wagon and plunges it into the Detroit River.</p><div id="afs:Card:029281580227" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="1e17fba2d7966f7436de96ddc974e530">Hub peek embed (apf-Health) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Motives can remain speculative in family killings in which assailants take their own lives, but police often cite financial or relationship issues as the causes.</p><p>Enoch police are still investigating what led to the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/utah-education-salt-lake-city-03b4048bf195b027b84c3337c676ce7a">deaths</a> discovered Wednesday, but authorities said Tausha Haight had recently filed a divorce petition against her husband Michael, a 42-year-old insurance agent who they believe killed her, their five children and Tausha’s mother, who was staying at the family’s home. </p><p>Officials have not released information on the weapon they believe killed the adults and the children, who ranged in age from 4 to 17. A relative of Tausha Haight <a href="https://apnews.com/article/utah-divorce-suicide-b2742ac684ad5fb4b0b506efac85578b">said</a> Friday that the family was left “vulnerable” after Michael Haight removed guns he and his wife owned in the days before the murder-suicide.</p><p>Police went to the Haight’s home on Wednesday in response to a welfare check call placed when Tausha Haight missed an appointment.</p><p>The news left mothers, fathers, teachers and churchgoers asking a question many communities face in the aftermath of mass shootings: How could this happen here?</p><p>City Councilman Rob Jensen said he was well aware such tragedies happen throughout the country, yet that did little to quell the shock he felt when the killings happened in his town.</p><p>“Especially in a small town, you don’t anticipate this kind of thing. Nobody does,” Jensen said. “Everyone knows this kind of thing can happen. But everyone wants to say that it’s not them.”</p><p>Family mass killings immediately capture the attention of people in a community, but rarely garner the level of national attention received by mass killings at schools, places of worship or restaurants, said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University who has studied familicides and mass killings for decades.</p><p>Fox, who helped compile and maintains the database for the AP and USA Today, said that’s because it doesn’t carry the same kind of fear with the public. He noted police often issue messages saying there is no danger to the public shortly after the killings are discovered.</p><p>“It’s a nice safe community, but family massacres are independent of the crime rate in the local area,” he said. “We are talking about internal factors, and I think that’s why it’s hard for people to see themselves in these situations and why the response is to mourn instead of fear.”</p><p>Family mass killings are in fact the most common type of mass killing, making up about 45% of the 415 mass shootings since 2006, according to the database. They happen twice as frequently as mass shootings in which members of the public are killed.</p><p>Most, but not all, involve handguns, only about a third involve households with a previous occurrence of domestic violence and most of the assailants have no violent history or criminal past, Fox said.</p><p>There is no governmental agency tracking murder-suicides nationally, so a few years ago policy analysts at the Violence Policy Center — a nonprofit educational organization that conducts research and public education on violence in the U.S. — began tracking details from news accounts to produce an annual report. The latest version from 2020 looked at murder-suicides including many mass killings during the first six months of 2019.</p><p>The study found 81% of murder-suicides happened at home and 65% involved intimate partners. The study also found that among murder-suicides where more than three people aside from the assailant were killed, six of the 10 during those six months were incidents in which a person killed their children, partner and themselves.</p><p>Fox said most of the killings fall into two categories. The first is murder by proxy, in which the killer is motivated by anger or resentment and kills the children who are seen as an extension of their partner. The second is suicide by proxy motivated by despondency or depression, most often a job loss, and the assailant kills the children as an extension of themselves.</p><p>"He wants to spare them the misery of living in this awful world," Fox said. “Over the years, there's been an eclipse in community. There was a time decades ago if you had trouble feeding your family or if you had lost your job, neighbors would come over with casseroles and they would offer emotional support. Many people don’t know their neighbors these days.”</p><p>___</p><p>Lauer reported from Philadelphia. </p>]]></description>

Death sentences in Iran are typically carried out by hanging.</p><p>At least 517 protesters have been killed and over 19,200 people have been arrested, according to Human Rights Activists in Iran, a group that has closely monitored the unrest. Iranian authorities have not provided an official count of those killed or detained.</p><p>The protests began in mid-September, when 22-year-old Amini died after being arrested by Iran’s morality police for allegedly violating the Islamic Republic’s strict dress code. Women have played a leading role in the protests, with many publicly stripping off the compulsory Islamic headscarf, known as the hijab.</p><p>The protests mark one of the biggest challenges to Iran's theocracy since the 1979 revolution. Security forces have used live ammunition, bird shot, tear gas and batons to disperse protesters, according to rights groups.</p><p>Also on Saturday, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appointed a new hard-line chief of police, the official IRNA news agency reported. Gen. Ahmad Reza Radan replaced outgoing Gen. Hossein Ashtari after Ashtari’s eight-year term of service ended.</p><p>Radan, who served as acting commander of police from 2008-2014, is known for his harsh handling of protesters during post-election turmoil in 2009. He also imposed measures against women wearing loose Islamic veils and young men with long hair. </p><p>The U.S. and Europe imposed sanctions on Radan for human rights violations in 2009 and 2010.</p><p>He has been in charge of a police research center since 2014.</p>]]></description>

But analysts predict it won't have any impact on the flow of drugs to the United States.</p><p>It was a display of muscle — helicopter gunships, hundreds of troops and armored vehicles — at the initiation of a possible extradition process rather than a significant step in a homegrown Mexican effort to dismantle one of the country’s most powerful criminal organizations. Perhaps coincidentally, it came just days before U.S President Joe Biden makes the first visit by a U.S. leader in almost a decade.</p><p>López Obrador has made clear throughout the first four years of his six-year term that pursuing drug capos is not his priority. When military forces cornered the younger Guzmán in Culiacan in 2019, the president ordered him freed to avoid loss of life after gunmen started shooting up the city. </p><p>The only other big capture under his administration was the grabbing of a geriatric Rafael Caro Quintero last July — just days after López Obrador met with Biden in the White House. At that point, Caro Quintero carried more symbolic significance for ordering a DEA agent’s murder decades ago than real weight in today’s drug world.</p><p>“Mexico wants to do at least the bare minimum in terms of counter-drug efforts,” said Mike Vigil, the DEA’s former chief of international operations who spent 13 years of his career in Mexico. “I don’t think that this is a sign that there’s going to be closer cooperation, bilateral collaboration, if you will, between the United States and Mexico.”</p><p>While capturing a criminal is a win for justice and rule of law, Vigil said, the impact on what he sees as a “permanent campaign against drugs” is nil. “Really what we need to do here in the United States is we need to do a better job in terms of reducing demand.”</p><div id="c4a19740044f4543bb30cda81f34b1e1" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>That was a key talking point when the U.S. and Mexican governments announced late in 2021 a new Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public Health and Safe Communities, replacing the outdated Merida Initiative. </p><p>The pact was supposed to take a more holistic approach to the scourge of drugs and the deaths they cause on both sides of the border. But underlining the frequent disconnect between diplomatic speech and reality, just two months later the U.S. government announced a $5 million reward for information leading to the capture of any of four of El Chapo’s sons, including Ovidio, signaling the U.S. kingpin strategy was alive and well.</p><p>“The Bicentennial understanding was a change on paper with respect to attacking drug trafficking and violence with a more important focus on what were supposedly public health programs — (but) without any budget,” said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, an associate professor at George Mason University. In reality, “Mexico is bending to the United States’ interests.”</p><p>For decades, the U.S. has nabbed drug kingpins from Mexico, Colombia and points between, but drugs are as available and more deadly in the United States as ever, she said. “The kingpin strategy is a failed strategy.”</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment on Ovidio Guzmán's arrest.</p><p>López Obrador took office in December 2018 after campaigning with a motto of “hugs, not bullets.” He shifted resources to social programs to address what he sees as violence’s root causes, a medium- to long-term approach that did little for a country suffering more than 35,000 homicides per year.</p><p>“Something that has characterized, in my opinion, Mexico’s security policy in recent years is that it isn’t very clear. It has been a bit contradictory,” said Ángelica Durán-Martínez, associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. That ambiguity makes it difficult to determine if there has really been a change, she said.</p><p>López Obrador’s government benefits from the detention of Guzmán in several ways. The arrest eases the armed forces’ humiliation after being forced by cartel gunmen to release him in 2019. It may sooth ill-feelings after his administration strictly limited U.S. anti-drug cooperation two years ago. And it may help diminish perceptions that López Obrador -- who has frequently visited Sinaloa and praised its people — has gone easier on the Sinaloa cartel than on other gangs.</p><p>For four years López Obrador has continued to shred his predecessors’ prosecution of the drug war at every opportunity. Experts say the respite allowed the cartels to get stronger, both in terms of organization and armament.</p><p>Guzmán during that time took a growing role after his father was sentenced to life in prison in the U.S. The younger Guzmán was indicted in Washington on drug trafficking charges along with another brother in 2018. He allegedly controlled a number of methamphetamine labs and was involved as the Sinaloa cartel expanded strongly into fentanyl production.</p><p>Synthetic drugs have been impervious to government eradication efforts, are easier to produce and smuggle, and are much more profitable. </p><p>The Sinaloa cartel hardly missed a beat when Guzmán's father was sent to the U.S., so the capture of one of the so-called “Chapitos,” as the brothers are known, is never going to shake the operation.</p><p>Mexican security analyst Alejandro Hope said the detention of Ovidio Guzman probably came as the result of pressure or information from the U.S. government, and marks the tacit abandonment of López Obrador’s rhetoric about ditching the kingpin strategy.</p><p>For Hope, the detention is depressing, not only because it won’t fundamentally change the Sinaloa cartel’s booming export trade in meth and fentanyl, but because it reveals how little investigation Mexican authorities had done on Guzmán and the cartel since 2019.</p><p>“How great that they got Ovidio, applause, perfect,” Hope said. “What depresses me is that we’ve been at this (drug war) for 16 years, or 40 counting from the (murder of DEA agent Enrique) Camarena, and we still don’t have the ability to investigate.”</p><p>After Guzmán's capture, Mexican officials said he was arrested on an existing U.S. extradition request, as well as for illegal weapons possession and attempted murder at the time they found him. On Friday, Interior Secretary Adán López Hernández said there were other Mexican investigations underway that they couldn’t talk about. </p><p>“We keep betting on the muscle, the military capabilities and not on the ability to investigate,” Hope said.</p>]]></description>

Anger was also vented over the requirement that anyone who potentially tested positive or had been in contact with such a person be confined for observation in a field hospital, where overcrowding, poor food and hygiene were commonly cited. </p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="3259cdf2fb41e8dd3d64f6c6d3b7cc80">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The social and economic costs eventually prompted rare street protests in Beijing and other cities, possibly influencing the party's decision to swiftly ease the strictest measures. </p><p>As part of the latest changes, China will also no longer bring criminal charges against people accused of violating border quarantine regulations, according to a notice issued by five government departments on Saturday. </p><p>Individuals currently in custody will be released and seized assets returned, the notice said. </p><p>The adjustments “were made after comprehensively considering the harm of the behaviors to the society, and aim to adapt to the new situations of the epidemic prevention and control," the official China Daily newspaper website said in a report on the notice. </p><p>China is now facing a surge in cases and hospitalizations in major cities and is bracing for a further spread into less developed areas <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-health-china-government-philippines-89822deed22950db4e9b6c5e9c675414">with the start of the Lunar New Year travel rush,</a> set to get underway in coming days. While international flights are still reduced, authorities say they expect domestic rail and air journeys will double over the same period last year, bringing overall numbers close to those of the 2019 holiday period before the pandemic hit.</p><p>The Transportation Ministry on Friday called on travelers to reduce trips and gatherings, particularly if they involve elderly people, pregnant women, small children and those with underlying conditions.</p><p>People using public transport are also urged to wear masks and pay special attention to their health and personal hygiene, Vice Minister Xu Chengguang told reporters at a briefing. </p><p>Nonetheless, China is forging ahead with a plan to end mandatory quarantines for people arriving from abroad beginning on Sunday. </p><p>Beijing also plans to drop a requirement for students at city schools to have a negative COVID-19 test to enter campus when classes resume Feb. 13 after the holiday break. While schools will be allowed to move classes online in the event of new outbreaks, they must return to in-person instruction as soon as possible, the city education bureau said in a statement Friday.</p><p>However, the end to mass testing, a highly limited amount of basic data such as the number of deaths, infections and severe cases, and the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/science-health-china-covid-306b688d84e31a9462f82d0ead1f4584">potential emergence of new variants</a> have prompted governments elsewhere to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-health-europe-european-union-beijing-5085b8ac7a6e773db5a96de63e978b45">institute virus testing requirements</a> for travelers from China. </p><p>The World Health Organization has also expressed concern about the lack of data from China, while the U.S. is requiring a negative test result for travelers from China within 48 hours of departure.</p><p>Chinese health authorities publish a daily count of new cases, severe cases and deaths, but those numbers include only officially confirmed cases and use a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-china-covid-d130817ed350e805295ee16c50ae6a46">very narrow definition of COVID-related deaths. </a></p><p>Authorities say that since the government ended compulsory testing and permitted people with mild symptoms to test themselves and convalesce at home, it can no longer provide a full picture of the state of the latest outbreak. </p><p>On Saturday, the National Health Commission reported 10,681 new domestic cases, bringing the country's total number of confirmed cases to 482,057. Three new deaths were also reported over the previous 24 hours, bringing the total to 5,267. </p><p>The numbers are a fraction of those announced by the U.S., which has put its death toll at more than 1 million among some 101 million cases. </p><p>But they're also much smaller than the estimates being released by some local governments. Zhejiang, a province on the east coast, said Tuesday it was seeing about 1 million new cases a day.</p><p>China has said the testing requirements being imposed by foreign governments — most recently Germany and Sweden — aren’t science-based and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-health-china-government-beijing-762d314d452875ecc525d5c21dbfa541">has threatened unspecified countermeasures.</a> Its spokespeople have said the situation is under control, and reject accusations of a lack of preparation for reopening.</p><p>Despite such assertions, the Health Commission on Saturday rolled out regulations for strengthened monitoring of viral mutations, including testing of urban wastewater. The lengthy rules called for increased data gathering from hospitals and local government health departments and stepped-up checks on “pneumonia of unknown causes." </p><p>If a variant emerges in an outbreak, it is found through genetic sequencing of the virus. </p><p>Since the pandemic started, China has shared 4,144 sequences with GISAID, a global platform for coronavirus data. That’s only 0.04% of its reported number of cases — a rate more than 100 times less than the United States and nearly four times less than neighboring Mongolia.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hong Kong also plans to reopen some of its border crossings with mainland China on Sunday and allow tens of thousands of people to cross every day without being quarantined. </p><p>The semi-autonomous southern Chinese city has been hard-hit by the virus and its land and sea border checkpoints with the mainland have been largely closed for almost three years. Despite the risk, the reopening is expected to provide a much-needed boost to Hong Kong’s tourism and retail sectors.</p><p>___</p><p>This story has been corrected to show that China's latest figures on cases and deaths were released on Saturday instead of Sunday.</p>]]></description>

Her condition had improved somewhat by late afternoon, Newport News Police Chief Steve Drew said.</p><p>“We did not have a situation where someone was going around the school shooting,” Drew told reporters, later adding that the gunshot was not an accident.</p><p>Drew said the student and teacher had known each other in a classroom setting.</p><p>He said the boy had a handgun in the classroom, and investigators were trying to figure out where he obtained it. The police chief did not provide further details about the shooting, the altercation or what happened inside the school.</p><p>Joselin Glover, whose son is in fourth grade, <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/crime/vp-nw-richneck-shooting-20230106-bx3uw6mhlzerbosms7zoahdlx4-story.html">told The Virginian-Pilot newspaper</a> she got a text from the school stating that one person was shot and another was in custody.</p><div id="afs:Card:849493086589" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="88dfe91f65173cbbd198a8816a21b5be">Hub peek embed (Education) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“My heart stopped,” she said. “I was freaking out, very nervous. Just wondering if that one person was my son.”</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Carlos, her 9-year-old, was at recess. But he said he and his classmates were soon holed up in the back of a classroom. </p><p>“Most of the whole class was crying,” Carlos told the newspaper.</p><p>Parents and students were reunited at a gymnasium door, Newport News Public Schools said via Facebook.</p><p>The police chief did not specifically address questions about whether authorities were in touch with the boy’s parents, but said members of the police department were handling that investigation. </p><p>“We have been in contact with our commonwealth’s attorney (local prosecutor) and some other entities to help us best get services to this young man,” Drew said. </p><p>Newport News is a city of about 185,000 people in southeastern Virginia known for its shipyard, which builds the nation's aircraft carriers and other U.S. Navy vessels. </p><div id="01b0c7cd2d6543bf8177586dcc33f072" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Richneck has about 550 students who are in kindergarten through fifth grade, according to the Virginia Department of Education’s website. School officials have already said that there will be no classes at the school on Monday. </p><p>“Today our students got a lesson in gun violence,” said George Parker III, Newport News schools superintendent, “and what guns can do to disrupt, not only an educational environment, but also a family, a community.” </p><p>Virginia law does not allow 6-year-olds to be tried as adults. </p><p>In addition, a 6-year-old is too young to be committed to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice if found guilty. </p><p>A juvenile judge would have authority, though, to revoke a parent’s custody and place a child under the purview of the Department of Social Services. </p><p>A school shooting involving a 6-year-old is extremely rare, said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Boston’s Northeastern University. </p><p>Fox told The Associated Press Friday evening that he could think of one previous incident involving a child that age. </p><p>In 2000, a 6-year-old boy fired a bullet from a .32-caliber gun inside Buell Elementary near Flint, Michigan, 60 miles (96 kilometers) from Detroit, striking 6-year-old Kayla Rolland in the neck, <a href="https://www.seacoastonline.com/story/news/2000/03/01/first-grader-shot-killed-by/51309235007/">according to an AP article from the time</a>. She died a half-hour later.</p><p>Fox analyzed school shooting data sets going back to 1970 from the Center for Homeland Defense and Security, which is located at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. He said the data listed school shootings involving children ages 7, 8, 9 and older, but not 6-year-olds. </p><p>Another factor that stands out about the Virginia shooting is that it occurred in a classroom, Fox said. Many occur outside a school building where students are unsupervised.</p><p>From 2010 through 2021, there were more than 800 school-related shootings in K-12 schools that involved 1,149 victims. Thirty percent of those occurred in the school building, said Fox, who published the 2010 book, “Violence and Security on Campus: From Preschool Through College.”</p><p>“There are students who killed teachers, more typically high school students,” Fox said. “I don’t know of other cases where a 6-year-old shot a teacher.” </p><p>___</p><p>Barakat reported from Falls Church, Virginia. </p>]]></description>

Now, as the Bills defensive back remains in critical condition in a Cincinnati hospital, fans are reflecting on their relationship with the sport they love. (AP Photo/John McCoy, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — It was uplifting enough for the Buffalo Bills staff and players to see Damar Hamlin appear on the video screen in the team's meeting room Friday — “larger than life," as coach Sean McDermott put it — for the first time since the safety collapsed and had to be resuscitated on the field. </p><p>What sent everyone’s emotions over the top was hearing Hamlin, his mouth and throat still raw shortly after having a breathing tube removed, softly say: “ <a href="https://twitter.com/buffalobills/status/1611383102013857792?s=46&amp;t=DLkzmw_N7MIb5HHvuuu6hQ">Love you, boys</a>.”</p><p>“Amazing. Touching. To see Damar, number one, through my own eyes, I know it’s something I’ve been looking forward to, kind of needing to see,” McDermott said. “And to see the players’ reaction. They stood up right away and clapped for him and yelled some things at him. It was a pretty cool exchange.”</p><p>Four days since his heart stopped after making what appeared to be a routine tackle in a game, the 24-year-old Hamlin from his hospital room in Cincinnati and the Bills enjoyed a moment of jubilation in celebrating the next step in what his doctors have termed a remarkable recovery.</p><p>“We got our boy, man. It’s all that matters,” left tackle Dion Dawkins said. </p><p>“To see the boy’s face, to see him smile and to see him go like this in the camera,” Dawkins said, flexing his muscles to mimic Hamlin, “it was everything. And then to hear him talk, it was literally everything. That’s what we needed.”</p><p>Hamlin is now breathing and talking on his own, and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/buffalo-bills-damar-hamlin-updates-c086e472b10b4e79cd24502bcbf2e09b">traded in the writing pad</a> he had been using to communicate. Though there is no timetable for his release, Hamlin’s doctors said Thursday that both breathing on his own and showing continued signs of improvement are the final steps for him to be discharged from the University of Cincinnati Medical Center.</p><p>Hamlin spent his first two days in the hospital under sedation. Upon being awakened on Wednesday evening, Hamlin was able to follow commands and grip people’s hands. The breathing tube was removed, the team said Friday, and Hamlin's “neurologic function remains intact.” </p><p>The team did not say whether Hamlin’s status remains critical or whether he’s been moved from intensive care.</p><p>In what was an expected formality, the Bills placed Hamlin on the season-ending injured reserve list and activated rookie cornerback Christian Benford from IR. Benford has been sidelined since sustaining an oblique injury on Thanksgiving Day.</p><p>“The hair on the back of my neck stood up when he said, 'I love you boys,’” said general manager Brandon Beane, who returned to Buffalo on Thursday after spending the three days at Hamlin’s bedside along with the player’s family.</p><p>The turning point in Hamlin’s recovery, for Beane, anyway, came Thursday morning when the two exchanged hugs.</p><p>“Just to be able to hug him and the grip strength that he had,” Beane said, before recalling what he told Hamlin’s father, Mario. “I told him, I’m not a crier, but man it was emotional and a lot of grown men in there crying yesterday. Something I’ll never forget.”</p><p>The reaction from around the NFL on Friday was just as heart-warming.</p><p>“Awesome. It’s probably uplifting for the entire league,” said New York Giants coach Brian Daboll, who spent the previous four seasons as the Bills offensive coordinator. “It gives you a boost because you’re praying so hard for the young man."</p><p>The NFL announced plans to show support for Hamlin during all Week 18 games, including a pregame moment of support, painting Hamlin’s No. 3 on the 30-yard line and pregame shirts with “Love for Damar 3.” The Bills will also wear “3” jersey patches.</p><p>New York Jets rookie cornerback Sauce Gardner was already planning to wear Hamlin’s No. 3 jersey during warmups before the team’s game at Miami on Sunday.</p><p>“What a warrior. He’s so strong, a fighter for sure,” Gardner said. “I was just so happy he was able to come back to the world.” </p><p>Interacting with Hamlin gave the Bills (12-3) some encouragement and allowed them to turn their attention to the season-ending home game against the New England Patriots (8-8) on Sunday. </p><p>“It’s going to be a celebration of life and an ongoing life,” Beane said, looking ahead. </p><p>“It’s not only going to be a celebration of Buffalo, but the whole country, and I’m sure people internationally that have watched this situation,” he added. “It’s going to be a cool deal, and the only thing better is if Damar was out there by then. I don’t know if that would happen, but anyway, we’re excited for Sunday.”</p><p>The sight of Hamlin collapsing, which was broadcast to a North American TV audience on ESPN’s “Monday Night Football,” has led to an outpouring of support from fans and players from across the league. Fans, team owners and players — including Tom Brady and Russell Wilson — have made donations to Hamlin’s Chasing M’s Foundation, which had raised just short of $8 million by Friday afternoon.</p><p>___</p><p>AP Pro Football Writer Dennis Waszak Jr. and AP Sports Writer Tom Canavan contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL </p>]]></description>

McCarthy was elected House speaker on a historic post-midnight 15th ballot early Saturday, overcoming holdouts and floor tensions after a chaotic week. (Jan. 7)</p>    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/kevin-mccarthy">Kevin McCarthy</a> was elected House speaker on a historic post-midnight 15th ballot early Saturday, overcoming holdouts from his own ranks and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-kevin-mccarthy-matt-gaetz-florida-f2a4a42b4845f2413cca5c1b4c6100dd">floor tensions that boiled over</a> after a chaotic week that tested the new GOP majority’s ability to govern.</p><p>“My father always told me, it’s not how you start, it’s how you finish,” McCarthy told cheering fellow Republicans. </p><p>Eager to confront President Joe Biden and the Democrats, he promised subpoenas and investigations. “Now the hard work begins," the California Republican declared. He credited former President Donald Trump for standing with him and for making late calls “helping get those final votes.”</p><p>Republicans roared in celebration when his victory was announced, chanting “USA! USA!”</p><p>Finally elected, McCarthy took the oath of office, and the House was finally able to swear in newly elected lawmakers who had been waiting all week for the chamber to formally open and the 2023-24 session to begin.</p><p>After four days of grueling ballots, McCarthy flipped more than a dozen conservative holdouts to become supporters, including the chairman of the chamber’s Freedom Caucus.</p><p>He fell one vote short on the 14th ballot, and the chamber became raucous, unruly.</p><p>McCarthy strode to the back of the chamber to confront Republican Matt Gaetz, sitting with Lauren Boebert and other holdouts. Fingers were pointed, words exchanged and violence apparently just averted.</p><div id="7055ffeea1fb439ba92819e89eeea4f4" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>At one point, Republican Mike Rogers of Alabama, shouting, approached Gaetz before another Republican, Richard Hudson of North Carolina, physically pulled him back.</p><p>“Stay civil!” someone shouted.</p><p>Order restored, the Republicans fell in line to give McCarthy the post he had fought so hard to gain, House speaker, second in the line of succession to the presidency.</p><p>The few remaining Republican holdouts began voting present, dropping the tally he needed. It was the end of a bitter standoff that had shown the strengths and fragility of American democracy. </p><p>The tally was 216-212 with Democrats voting for leader Hakeem Jeffries, and six Republican holdouts to McCarthy simply voting present.</p><p>The night's stunning turn of events came after McCarthy agreed to many of the detractors’ demands — including the reinstatement of a longstanding House rule that would allow any single member to call a vote to oust him from office. </p><p>Even as McCarthy secured the votes he needs, he will emerge as a weakened speaker, having given away some powers and constantly under the threat of being booted by his detractors. </p><p>But he could also be emboldened as a survivor of one of the more brutal fights for the gavel in U.S. history. Not since the Civil War era has a speaker's vote dragged through so many rounds of voting. </p><p>The showdown that has stymied the new Congress came against the backdrop of the second anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, which shook the country when a mob of Trump’s supporters tried to stop Congress from certifying the Republican’s 2020 election defeat to Biden.</p><p>At a Capitol event Friday, some lawmakers, all but one of them Democrats, observed a moment of silence and praised officers who helped protect Congress on that day. And at the White House, Biden handed out medals to officers and others who fought the attackers.</p><p>“America is a land of laws, not chaos,” he said.</p><p>At the afternoon speaker's vote, a number of Republicans tiring of the spectacle temporarily walked out when one of McCarthy's most ardent challengers, Gaetz, railed against the GOP leader.</p><p>Contours of a deal with conservative holdouts who had been blocking McCarthy's rise had emerged the night before, and took hold after four dismal days and 14 failed votes in an intraparty standoff <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-house-of-representatives-kentucky-kevin-mccarthy-e177c4405ef9b8a7b38641a15855764c">unseen in modern times</a>. </p><p>One significant former holdout — Republican Scott Perry, chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus, who had been a leader of Trump's efforts to challenge the 2020 election — tweeted after his switched vote for McCarthy, “We're at a turning point.”</p><p>Trump may have played a role in swaying some holdouts — calling into a meeting of Republican freshmen the night before, and calling other members ahead of voting. He had urged Republicans to wrap up their public dispute.</p><p>As Republican Mike Garcia of California nominated McCarthy on an earlier ballot Friday, he also thanked the U.S. Capitol Police, who were given a standing ovation for protecting lawmakers and the legislative seat of democracy on Jan. 6, 2021. </p><p>But in nominating the Democratic leader Jeffries, Democrat Jim Clyburn of South Carolina recalled the horror of that day. “The eyes of the country are on us today,” he told his colleagues.</p><p>Electing a speaker is normally an easy, joyous task for a party that has just won majority control. But not this time: About 200 Republicans were stymied by 20 far-right colleagues who said McCarthy was not conservative enough. Only the 12th ballot on Friday afternoon did McCarthy start making gains, flipping their votes to support.</p><p>The House adjourned Friday until late in the night, giving time for last-minute negotiations and allowing two absent Republican colleagues to return to Washington.</p><p>The disorganized start to the new Congress pointed to difficulties ahead with Republicans now in control of the House, much the way that some past Republican speakers, including John Boehner, had trouble leading a rebellious right flank. The result: government shutdowns, standoffs and Boehner’s early retirement when conservatives threatened to oust him. </p><p>The agreement McCarthy presented to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/congress-mccarthy-hard-right-foes-5edc1d9468e606a3f1230e98702d9a23">the holdouts</a> from the Freedom Caucus and others centers around rules changes they have been seeking for months. Those changes would shrink the power of the speaker’s office and give rank-and-file lawmakers more influence in drafting and passing legislation.</p><p>At the core of the emerging deal was the reinstatement of a House rule that would allow a single lawmaker to make a motion to “vacate the chair,” essentially calling a vote to oust the speaker. McCarthy had resisted allowing a return to the longstanding rule that former Speaker Nancy Pelosi had done away with, because it had been held over the head of Boehner. But it appears McCarthy had no other choice.</p><p>Other wins for the holdouts are more obscure and include provisions in the proposed deal to expand the number of seats available on the House Rules Committee; to mandate 72 hours for bills to be posted before votes; and to promise to try for a constitutional amendment that would impose federal limits on the number of terms a person could serve in the House and Senate.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Mary Clare Jalonick and Kevin Freking and video journalists Nathan Ellgren and Mike Pesoli contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Taylor Swift was up. Elon Musk was in, out, in and maybe out again. Tom Cruise was back. BTS stepped aside, and so did Serena Williams, and Tom Brady too — oops, scratch that.</p><p>But the slap? <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-oscars-show-9a69424884de11649b68a12a284353a1">The slap</a> was everywhere.</p><p>Ok, so maybe it wasn’t on the level of a moon landing, or selection of a pope. But henceforth all you need say is “the slap” and people will know what you mean — that moment Will Smith smacked Chris Rock at the Oscars and a global audience said, “Wait, did that happen?" <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-oscars-top-moments-f26255e20fd810a3fe0d6722eb9df5ac">Even in the room itself</a> — maybe especially in the room itself — there was a sense everyone had imagined it, which helps explain why things went on as normal, for a bit.</p><p>The pandemic was over, phew! Well, of course it wasn’t.
