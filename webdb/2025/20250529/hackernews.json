It's a Mac app we built with Electron that uses CLIP embeddings to search photos and videos locally with natural language. We got positive feedback from HN and our first paying customers, but the app was almost 1GB and clunky to use.\u003cp\u003eTLDR; rebuilding in Rust was the right move.\u003cp\u003eSo we rewrote the app with Rust and Tauri and here are the results:\u003cp\u003e- App size is 83% smaller: 1GB → 172MB\n- DMG Installer is 70% smaller: 232MB → 69.5MB\n- Indexing files is faster: A 38-minute video now indexes in ~3 minutes instead of 10-14 minutes\n- Overall more stability (old app used to randomly crash)\u003cp\u003eThe original version worked, but it didn't perform well when you tried indexing thousands of images or large videos. We lost a lot of time struggling to optimize Electron’s main-renderer process communication and ended up with a complex worker system to process large batches of media files.\u003cp\u003eFor months we wrestled with indecision about continuing to optimize the Electron app vs. starting a full rebuild in Swift or Rust. The main thing holding us back was that we hadn’t coded in Swift in almost 10 years and we didn’t know Rust very well.\u003cp\u003eWhat finally broke us was when users complained the app crashed their video calls just running in background. I guess that’s what happens when you ship an app with Chromium that takes up 200mb before any application code.\u003cp\u003eToday the app still uses CLIP for embeddings and Redis for vector storage and search, except Rust now handles the image and video processing pipeline and all the file I/O to let users browse their entire machine, not just indexed files.\u003cp\u003eFor the UI, we decided to rebuild it from scratch instead of porting over the old UI. This turned out well because it resulted in a cleaner, simpler UI after living with the complexity of the old version.\u003cp\u003eThe trickiest part of the migration was learning Rust. LLMs definitely help, but the Rust/Tauri community just isn’t as mature compared to Electron. Bundling Redis into the app was a permissioning nightmare, but I think our solution with Rust handles this better than what we had with Electron.\u003cp\u003eAll in, the rebuild took about two months and still needs some more work to be at total parity with its Electron version, but the core functionality of indexing and searching files is way more performant than before and that made it worth the time. Sometimes you gotta throw away working code to build the right thing.\u003cp\u003eAMA about Rust/Tauri migration, Redis bundling nightmares, how CLIP embeddings work for local semantic search, or why Electron isn't always the answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44118023\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44118023\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 363\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 270\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://desktopdocs.com/?v=2025","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44118023","date_published":"2025-05-28T16:53:11Z","author":{"name":"katrinarodri","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=katrinarodri"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44117779","title":"Japan Post launches 'digital address' system","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2025/05/27/companies/japan-post-digital-address/\"\u003ehttps://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2025/05/27/companies/japan-post-digital-address/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44117779\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44117779\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 145\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 95\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2025/05/27/companies/japan-post-digital-address/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44117779","date_published":"2025-05-28T16:33:49Z","author":{"name":"jmsflknr","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jmsflknr"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44117722","title":"Compiler Explorer and the promise of URLs that last forever","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://xania.org/202505/compiler-explorer-urls-forever\"\u003ehttps://xania.org/202505/compiler-explorer-urls-forever\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44117722\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44117722\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 184\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 97\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://xania.org/202505/compiler-explorer-urls-forever","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44117722","date_published":"2025-05-28T16:28:20Z","author":{"name":"anarazel","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=anarazel"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44117302","title":"Getting a Cease and Desist from Waffle House","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://www.jack.bio/blog/wafflehouse\"\u003ehttps://www.jack.bio/blog/wafflehouse\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44117302\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44117302\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 230\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 141\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.jack.bio/blog/wafflehouse","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44117302","date_published":"2025-05-28T15:48:37Z","author":{"name":"lafond","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=lafond"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44117059","title":"Show HN: Tesseral – Open-Source Auth","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHi folks! I'm Ulysse, and Tesseral (\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/tesseral-labs/tesseral\"\u003ehttps://github.com/tesseral-labs/tesseral\u003c/a\u003e) is open-source auth for B2B SaaS.\u003cp\u003eEarly in my career, I worked on enterprise auth and security features at Segment. I've been obsessed with the subtle details of enterprise software ever since. For example, I wrote an implementation of SAML in the early days of the COVID pandemic because I thought it was fun.\u003cp\u003eOver the years, I've felt frustrated that too few people have seemed interested in making auth obvious for developers of business software. Auth really doesn't need to be so confusing.\u003cp\u003eWe made Tesseral to help software engineers get B2B auth exactly right – and focus their energy on building the features that users want.\u003cp\u003eYou can use Tesseral to stand up a login page, authenticate your users, and manage their access to resources. Think of it like Auth0 or Clerk, but open source and built specifically for B2B apps. Among other things, that means that it’s designed for B2B multi-tenancy and includes enterprise-ready features like single sign-on (SAML SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), SCIM provisioning, and role-based access control (RBAC).\u003cp\u003eFor those who expose public APIs, you can use Tesseral to manage API keys for your customers. You can even limit the scope of API keys to specific actions by using our RBAC feature.\u003cp\u003eWe've taken care to make Tesseral powerful and secure enough to power real enterprise software but still leave it simple enough for any software developer to use. You don't have to be a security expert to implement Tesseral. (By default, therefore, Tesseral imposes a few opinions. Let us know if you have a good reason to do something unusual, and we'll work something out.)\u003cp\u003eIf you want to experiment with Tesseral, you can host it yourself or use our hosted service. The hosted service lives at \u003ca href=\"https://console.tesseral.com\"\u003ehttps://console.tesseral.com\u003c/a\u003e.

HN: AutoThink – Boosts local LLM performance with adaptive reasoning","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eI built AutoThink, a technique that makes local LLMs reason more efficiently by adaptively allocating computational resources based on query complexity.\u003cp\u003eThe core idea: instead of giving every query the same \"thinking time,\" classify queries as HIGH or LOW complexity and allocate thinking tokens accordingly. Complex reasoning gets 70-90% of tokens, simple queries get 20-40%.\u003cp\u003eI also implemented steering vectors derived from Pivotal Token Search (originally from Microsoft's Phi-4 paper) that guide the model's reasoning patterns during generation. These vectors encourage behaviors like numerical accuracy, self-correction, and thorough exploration.\u003cp\u003eResults on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B:\u003cp\u003e- GPQA-Diamond: 31.06% vs 21.72% baseline (+43% relative improvement)\u003cp\u003e- MMLU-Pro: 26.38% vs 25.58% baseline\u003cp\u003e- Uses fewer tokens than baseline approaches\u003cp\u003eWorks with any local reasoning model - DeepSeek, Qwen, custom fine-tuned models. No API dependencies.\u003cp\u003eThe technique builds on two things I developed: an adaptive classification framework that can learn new complexity categories without retraining, and an open source implementation of Pivotal Token Search.\u003cp\u003eTechnical paper: \u003ca href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5253327\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5253327\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eCode and examples: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/codelion/optillm/tree/main/optillm/autothink\"\u003ehttps://github.com/codelion/optillm/tree/main/optillm/autoth...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003ePTS implementation: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/codelion/pts\"\u003ehttps://github.com/codelion/pts\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eI'm curious about your thoughts on adaptive resource allocation for AI reasoning.
