Tattoy solves this by using none other than the web's WCAG 2.1 contrast algorithm for accessible text.\u003cp\u003eSecondly, an explicit design goal is that Tattoy should be able to polyfill new terminal protocols, the `xwayland` of the TTY if you will. Say if we want to experiment with completely deprecating ANSI codes, then any application that uses a new protocol can be run in Tattoy which itself runs in any ANSI-standard terminal emulator as normal.
