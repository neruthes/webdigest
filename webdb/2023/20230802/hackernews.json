We’re Kevin and Steve. We’re building PromptTools (\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/hegelai/prompttools\"\u003ehttps://github.com/hegelai/prompttools\u003c/a\u003e): open-source, self-hostable tools for experimenting with, testing, and evaluating LLMs, vector databases, and prompts.\u003cp\u003eEvaluating prompts, LLMs, and vector databases is a painful, time-consuming but necessary part of the product engineering process. Our tools allow engineers to do this in a lot less time.\u003cp\u003eBy “evaluating” we mean checking the quality of a model's response for a given use case, which is a combination of testing and benchmarking. As examples:\n- For generated JSON, SQL, or Python, you can check that the output is actually JSON, SQL, or executable Python. \n- For generated emails, you can use another model to assess the quality of the generated email given some requirements, like whether or not the email is written professionally. \n- For a question-answering chatbot, you can check that the actual answer is semantically similar to an expected answer.\u003cp\u003eAt Google, Steve worked with HuggingFace and Lightning to support running the newest open-source models on TPUs. He realized that while the open-source community was contributing incredibly powerful models, it wasn’t so easy to discover and evaluate them. It wasn’t clear when you could use Llama or Falcon instead of GPT-4. We began looking for ways to simplify and scale this evaluation process.\u003cp\u003eWith PromptTools, you can write a short Python script (as short as 5 lines) to run such checks across models, parameters, and prompts, and pass the results into an evaluation function to get scores. All these can be executed on your local machine without sending data to third-parties. Then we help you turn those experiments into unit tests and CI/CD that track your model’s performance over time.\u003cp\u003eToday we support all of the major model providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, HuggingFace, and even LlamaCpp, and vector databases like ChromaDB and Weaviate. You can evaluate responses via semantic similarity, auto-evaluation by a language model, or structured output validations like JSON and Python. We even have a notebook UI for recording manual feedback.\u003cp\u003eQuickstart:\u003cp\u003e\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e  pip install prompttools\n  git clone https://github.com/hegelai/prompttools.git\n  cd prompttools \u0026\u0026 jupyter notebook examples/notebooks/OpenAIChatExperiment.ipynb\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\nFor detailed instructions, see our documentation at \u003ca href=\"https://prompttools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"\u003ehttps://prompttools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cp\u003eWe also have a playground UI, built in streamlit, which is currently in beta: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/hegelai/prompttools/tree/main/prompttools/playground\"\u003ehttps://github.com/hegelai/prompttools/tree/main/prompttools...\u003c/a\u003e.

We're Nick, Patrick, Philip, Sebastian, Sven, and Timo from Titap (\u003ca href=\"https://tiptap.dev/\"\u003ehttps://tiptap.dev/\u003c/a\u003e), an open source developer toolkit for building collaborative editing apps. Our editor framework, based on ProseMirror, is at \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap\"\u003ehttps://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap\u003c/a\u003e, and our real-time collaboration backend, based on Yjs, is at \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/ueberdosis/hocuspocus\"\u003ehttps://github.com/ueberdosis/hocuspocus\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cp\u003eBuilding editor interfaces like Notion or Google Docs in your web app takes a lot of work and time. Our open source tools and cloud services let you build collaborative content editing faster—in days or weeks, rather than months or years. And this is just for the editor. If you want real-time collaboration or other advanced features like version history in your editor, the overall workload quickly escalates—you will need a robust and serious backend infrastructure that requires even more time to set up and maintain. This doesn’t make sense for most frontend developers or most startups.\u003cp\u003eWe spent eight years as a digital agency developing applications with complex content editing functionality. We learned the hard way how limited the existing editors were. After building Tiptap as a headless editor framework with an extension-based architecture, we needed to allow multiple users to edit content simultaneously, which got complicated. There was no simple solution that could be integrated quickly. So we built that too.\u003cp\u003eThe Tiptap editor is based on the JS framework ProseMirror, which is a good foundation for editors. The learning curve for ProseMirror is steep because it's complicated to understand and lacks simple APIs and documentation. It takes a lot of code around ProseMirror to develop a modern user experience. We’ve taken care of that for you.\u003cp\u003eTiptap is headless, so it will work with whatever frontend or design you have in mind—we make no assumptions about your UI. You can use it to develop block-based editors like Notion, classic interfaces like Google Docs, or whatever you need. It's also framework agnostic, so you can use it with React, Vue, etc., or vanilla JavaScript. And it's highly customizable through our extension architecture. We also provide an API to access ProseMirror's internals through Tiptap if you want to dig deep into the core.\u003cp\u003eAdding real-time collaboration to your editor is as easy as installing and configuring an extension. Our collaboration backend, called Hocuspocus, uses Yjs. This is a widely used implementation of CRDTs (conflict- free replicated data type). Hocuspocus makes it easy to set up a Node.js websocket server to handle communication between multiple peers to synchronize data. Like the Tiptap editor, Hocuspocus is designed to be extensible according to your needs. Also, Hocuspocus can work independently of Tiptap with other editors like Lexical or Slate.\u003cp\u003eAn earlier version of Tiptap got discussed a couple years ago at \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26901975\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26901975\u003c/a\u003e. We’ve been enjoying wider adoption since then. For example, Substack uses Tiptap for their editor that allows creators to write content on substack.com, and YC uses Tiptap in their Bookface forum (which is basically HN for YC alums).\u003cp\u003eWith the Tiptap Cloud, we offer managed backend services if you don't want to build and maintain every feature yourself. For real-time collaboration, we provide a cloud infrastructure with multiple datacenter regions where you can deploy Hocuspocus. The Tiptap AI integration beta is a service where you connect your OpenAI API key to our backend and install the Tiptap editor AI extension to get AI writing experience in your editor. Here’s a demo: \u003ca href=\"https://ai-demo.tiptap.dev/\"\u003ehttps://ai-demo.tiptap.dev/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe invite you to explore Tiptap's capabilities in your app, contribute to its open source development, and (hopefully!) join our welcoming community. We'd love to hear what you've already built with Tiptap or what's stopping you from creating something with it :-) We look forward to all of your comments!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36957204\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36957204\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 150\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 62\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36957204","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36957204","date_published":"2023-08-01T15:24:51Z","author":{"name":"philipisik","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=philipisik"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36956867","title":"Ask HN: Who is hiring?
