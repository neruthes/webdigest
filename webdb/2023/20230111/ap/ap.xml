(AP Photo/Eraldo Peres, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>MIAMI (AP) — The Biden administration is under growing pressure from leftists in Latin America as well as U.S. lawmakers to expel Jair Bolsonaro from a post-presidential retreat in Florida following his supporters' brazen attack on Brazil's capital over the weekend.</p><p>But the far-right ex-president may pre-empt any plans for such a stinging rebuke. On Tuesday, he told a Brazilian media outlet that he would push up his return home, originally scheduled for late January, after being hospitalized with abdominal pains stemming from a 2018 stabbing.</p><p>“I came to spend some time away with my family but these weren’t calm days,” Bolsonaro told CNN’s Portuguese-language affiliate in Brazil. “First, there was this sad episode in Brazil and then my hospitalization.” </p><p>Bolsonaro arrived in Florida in late December, skipping the Jan. 1 swearing-in of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who became the first elected Brazilian president not to receive the presidential sash from his predecessor since democracy was restored in the 1980s. Bolsonaro is reportedly staying at the Orlando-area home of Brazilian mixed martial arts fighter Jose Aldo, a fervent supporter. </p><p>His visit to the Sunshine state went largely unnoticed in the U.S. until Sunday's attack by thousands of die-hard supporters who had been camping for weeks outside a military base in Brasilia, refusing to accept Bolsonaro's narrow defeat in an October runoff. Their invasion of Brazil’s congress and presidential palace left behind shattered glass, smashed computers and slashed artwork.</p><div id="afs:Card:347160095803" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="5d5f0fb703ddc7de29fdad93a0149435">Hub peek embed (JairBolsonaro) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Almost from the moment the images of destruction were broadcast to the world, Democrats voiced concern about Bolsonaro’s continued presence on U.S. soil, drawing parallels between the rampage in Brazil and the Jan. 6, 2020, insurrection by allies of Donald Trump who stormed the Capitol to try to overturn the U.S. presidential election results.</p><p>Among those calling for President Joe Biden to give Bolsonaro the boot was Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p><p>“Nearly two years to the day the U.S. Capitol was attacked by fascists, we see fascist movements abroad attempt to do the same in Brazil,” the New York City lawmaker said. “The U.S. must cease granting refuge to Bolsonaro in Florida.”</p><p>It should be a no brainer for the White House, experts say. </p><p>Biden has never had a close relationship with Bolsonaro, who made common cause with Trump's top allies on the far right. And any action to expel him is likely to play well in Latin America, where Biden is courting a crop of new leftist leaders who have risen to power in places like Chile and Colombia expressing similar concerns about threats to democracy.</p><p>“It’s one thing to make statements about support for democracy,” said John Feeley, a longtime U.S. diplomat in Latin America who resigned as ambassador to Panama in 2018 over differences with the Trump administration. </p><p>“It’s another to actually take action in your own home, where you have sovereign control, with someone who is clearly in league with the same folks who brought you Jan. 6,” Feeley said.</p><p>But so far the Biden administration has proceeded cautiously. </p><p>On Monday, State Department spokesman Ned Price, while sidestepping questions about Bolsonaro's presence, said anyone entering the U.S. on a so-called A-1 visa reserved for sitting heads of state would have 30 days to either leave the country or adjust their status with the Department of Homeland Security at the conclusion of their term of office.</p><p>Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, was similarly circumspect, saying only that any request from Brazil’s government related to Bolsonaro would be evaluated, taking into consideration legal precedent. Typically, the U.S. is reluctant to discuss visa issues out of privacy concerns.</p><p>Feeley said the longer the Biden administration waits the weaker its support for democracy will be perceived in the region.</p><p>One place Bolsonaro apparently isn't going is Italy. The former president is the descendant of 19th-century immigrants from northern Italy and Brazilian media had speculated for months that he and his children would seek Italian citizenship out of fear he could be prosecuted in Brazil for corruption or his mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic. </p><p>But Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani told state radio on Tuesday that Bolsonaro has never requested citizenship — despite being bestowed honorary citizenship in 2021 by the small town where his great-grandfather was born. </p><p>“There are laws that address who gets citizenship,″ Tajani said, emphasizing his far-right-led government’s strong condemnation of the raid on Brazilian government institutions by Bolsonaro supporters. "It is not a political, discretionary choice.”</p><p>—-</p><p>AP Writers Matt Lee in Washington and Colleen Barry in Milan contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Odelyn Joseph)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Haiti awoke Tuesday stripped of its last democratically elected institution — this time, its Senate — an alarming development that solidifies what some call a de facto dictatorship nominally in charge of a country wracked by gang violence.</p><p>While only 10 senators had been symbolically representing the nation's 11 million people in recent years because Haiti had failed to hold legislative elections since October 2019, their terms expired overnight, leaving Haiti without a single lawmaker in its House or Senate amid a spiraling political crisis. Organized crime groups have been running virtually unchecked since the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse, who himself had been ruling by decree.</p><p>“It's a very grim situation,” said Alex Dupuy, a Haitian-born sociologist at Wesleyan University, "one of the worst crises that Haiti has had since the Duvalier dictatorship.” </p><p>The bloody regime of Jean-Claude “Baby Doc” Duvalier, who fled the country in 1986, marked the last time Haiti lacked elected officials.</p><p>The Parliament building in downtown Port-au-Prince remained deserted on Tuesday, with only security guards at the gate. Similar scenes were evident outside Haiti's non-functioning Supreme Court and electoral commission.</p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="36dad35dce439953e59af39a449206c0">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Meanwhile, Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who assumed leadership of Haiti with the backing of the international community after Moïse was killed, has failed to hold general elections despite multiple pledges over the last year and a half to do so. His latest promise, on Jan. 1, was that the Supreme Court would be restored and a provisional electoral council tasked with setting a reasonable date for elections. </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>But Henry offered no timeline, even as he asked Haitians to trust each other and “take me at my word when I speak of my government’s desire to do everything possible to reconstitute our democratic institutions.”</p><p>“There are no powers to check his decisions,” Dupuy said. “As long as that situation continues, Henry is going to be behaving like a dictator.”</p><p>A spokesman for Henry's office declined to comment.</p><p>The U.N. has warned that security in Haiti needs to improve before elections are held. Reported kidnappings soared to more than 1,200 last year, double what was reported the previous year, according to the U.N., and at least 280 killings were reported in November alone, the highest monthly record.</p><p>Briefing the U.N. Security Council in December, Helen La Lime, who was appointed Haiti’s U.N. special envoy in October 2019, described what she called “alarmingly high levels of gang violence” in Haiti, which has fewer than 9,000 active police officers nationwide.</p><p>The gangs increasingly rely on kidnappings to fund their operations, with experts estimating that they control about 60% of Port-au-Prince.</p><p>“We are scared to step out of our houses,” said Daniel Jean, 25, who sells phone chargers and other equipment in the capital. “We are cornered: kidnapping, extortions. Gangs are killing people because we don’t have ransom.”</p><p>Haitians have lost all trust in the democratic process, Jean said, adding that he won't vote if the same politicians and parties appear on the ballot: “They have more influence than the gangs. They control all the gangs.</p><p>“This is why the country is not going to move forward until the international community ... comes in to help,” he said.</p><p>Henry requested the immediate deployment of foreign troops in October after the most powerful gang seized control of a key fuel terminal, cutting off supplies to hospitals, schools, businesses and homes. </p><p>But the United States and Canada, among others, have responded only by implementing sanctions, not sending troops.</p><p>“Haiti needs stability,” decried Andrea Marcele, 29, who sells yams, lemons, carrots and other goods in the streets of the capital after migrating from the northern region of Grand-Anse. </p><p>“The country has no president ... no elected officials,” she said. “Everybody is hungry for power. We are paying the consequences.”</p><p>As the situation worsens, Haitians increasingly flee by plane or aboard rickety boats, desperately risking their lives to reach some safety and economic security. Many aim for the Bahamas, or Florida. President Joe Biden's administration intercepted tens of thousands last year, sending them back to Haiti. </p><p>Rodelie Kator, 49, sells rice, beans and other goods, hoping to send her 18-year-old son to Chile or Brazil, popular destination points for Haitians who then try to reach Mexico and cross into the United States.</p><p>“I’m hoping for a better life for my son,” she said. “I don’t want to witness him being killed.”</p><p>Kator said she wishes he could stay in Haiti because she has seen in the news “what my brothers and sisters have to go through to get to Mexico. ... being treated like animals.”</p><p>But Haiti holds no promise for her son, even as Biden announced last week that his administration would immediately turn away Haitians and other migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.</p><p>Haitian economist Enomy Germain tried to use this moment, with zero elected officials in Haiti, to encourage his countrymen.</p><p>“This date will have marked the beginning of the end of a political class without vision — without regard for the common good and without balance — if you good people get involved," he tweeted. "Know that tomorrow will not be better without you.”</p><p>But even if elections were to be held, many Haitians wonder whether any candidate will be worthy of their support as they fear for their life.</p><p>“It feels like we’re heading toward a civil war,” said Marcele. “You’re walking with a coffin under your arm.”</p><p>___</p><p>Coto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The House Ethics Committee was asked Tuesday to investigate <a href="https://apnews.com/article/george-santos-house-of-representatives-d65613ce8bcda757bf3b89c3d0fcfa82">Rep. George Santos</a>, the newly-elected Republican from New York who has admitted to lying about his job experience, college education and even family heritage, and now faces questions about his campaign financial disclosures.</p><p>Two Democrats requested the probe, saying Santos “has failed to uphold the integrity expected of members of the House of Representatives.” </p><p>In a letter to the Ethics Committee, Democratic Reps. Ritchie Torres and Dan Goldman, both of New York, said Santos also failed to file “timely, accurate and complete” financial disclosure reports as required by law. They said the reports Santos did file are “sparse and perplexing.” They asked the panel to investigate and “take appropriate action as soon as possible.”</p><p>Some Democratic leaders said Santos should be expelled from the House.</p><p>A spokesperson for Santos did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-business-bb455cc02b70e5366b9c5e347da8ad38">Santos has admitted to fabricating</a> several aspects of his life story and experience in his run for the House seat that he won in November, helping to give <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-house-of-representatives-kevin-mccarthy-us-republican-party-0938c7358f41c83759246f8949ac7c15?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=TopNews&amp;utm_campaign=position_01">Republicans a narrow majority.</a> Nevertheless, the newly-elected lawmaker was sworn into office last week alongside all other members of the House.</p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="17bfaa6420fb5bf1f8b0c20ffbeac2e9">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Republican leaders have refused to take action against Santos, whose election helped give them a 222-seat hold on the House majority. Santos also voted last week in the raucous balloting to make <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-house-of-representatives-kevin-mccarthy-government-e986c620149b72030bb418bd5fadb4a2">GOP leader Kevin McCarthy the House speaker.</a></p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Majority Leader Steve Scalise said Tuesday the situation is being “handled internally” by Republicans. </p><p>“Obviously there were concerns about what we had heard,” said Scalise, R-La. “So we’re gonna have to sit down and talk to him about it.”</p><p>Santos admitted two weeks ago that he lied about his job experience and college education during his successful campaign for a seat in the U.S. House.</p><p>Santos had also said he had worked for Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, but neither company could find any records verifying that.</p><p>In an interview with the New York Post, Santos said: “My sins here are embellishing my resume. I’m sorry.”</p><p>He also explained that he never claimed to be Jewish after the Jewish American site The Forward had questioned a claim on Santos’ campaign website that his grandparents “fled Jewish persecution in Ukraine, settled in Belgium, and again fled persecution during WWII.”</p><p>Democrats were scathing in their criticism.</p><p>“Kevin McCarthy owns George Santos, lock stop and barrel," said Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus. “It’s the only reason why he was seated, to give George Santos that ability to vote for Kevin McCarthy. So let’s call this exactly what it is. There should be repercussions.”</p><p>It's unclear the Ethics Committee's next steps. As part of the new House rules package, any member of the public can now file complaints against lawmakers. Ethics advocates have warned other new rules will weaken the committee's staff and membership.</p><p>The committee has not fully formed yet as House Republicans are in the midst of choosing committee chairs, members and setting up the new Congress.</p>]]></description>

But the Mets also had <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mlb-health-sports-baseball-new-york-mets-0e806f6ba1b701c8b540b6c3089a1811">concerns about the ankle after a Dec. 22 physical</a> and held off finalizing the agreement while attempting to negotiate protections over the next two weeks.</p><p>A deal with the Twins was reached Tuesday calling for an $8 million signing bonus, half payable next month and half in February 2024, and salaries of $32 million in each of the first two seasons, $36 million in 2025, $31.5 million in 2026, $30.5 million in 2027 and $30 million in 2028.</p><p>Minnesota's deal includes team options for $25 million in 2029, $20 million in 2030, $15 million in 2031 and $10 million in 2032, salaries that would become guaranteed if Correa has 575 plate appearances in 2028, 550 in 2029, 525 in 2030 and 502 in 2031. The contract could be worth $225 million over seven seasons, $245 million over eight years and $260 million over nine seasons.</p><p>Correa's options also could be triggered by a top-five finish in MVP voting, a Silver Slugger award or World Series or League Championship Series MVP.</p><p>After the physical, the Mets were willing to guarantee $157.5 million over six seasons, the person said.</p><p>While the guaranteed money kept decreasing in each successive agreement, the average annual value increased from $26.9 million with San Francisco to $33.3 million with Minnesota. New York's deal originally would have guaranteed $210 million in the first eight seasons.</p><p>Correa left Houston and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mlb-covid-sports-health-minnesota-df95205717e5c2d3037d22ae16f0ac89">joined the Twins last offseason for a $105.3 million, three-year deal</a> that included opt-outs after each season. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mlb-sports-baseball-minnesota-twins-e3bf1ebd18c109641c3196599691b72d">He pulled out of the deal after making $35.1 million in 2022</a> to chase a longer-term contract.</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/mlb-sports-new-york-yankees-carlos-correa-farhan-zaidi-1e13e9a79d227c12d43a419a08b5dcc4">Boras maintained last month the player's 2014 surgery to repair a broken right tibia should not have been an issue</a>. Dr. Kevin Varner, chairman of the Department of Orthopedics at Houston Methodist Hospital, operated on Correa.</p><p>Boras in prior years had worked out medical issues in contracts for Ivan Rodriguez and Magglio Ordóñez with Detroit and for J.D. Drew and J.D. Martinez in Boston.</p><p>Correa, the first overall pick in the 2012 amateur draft and the 2015 AL Rookie of the Year with Houston, has a .279 batting average with 155 homers and 553 RBIs in eight major league seasons. He also has been a stellar postseason performer with 18 homers and 59 RBIs in 79 games, winning a World Series title in 2017 with the Astros.</p><p>The two-time All-Star and 2021 Gold Glove winner raved about his time with Minnesota and how much he and his family enjoyed the community, maintaining all along the Twins were in the mix even with the bigger spenders pursuing him in a particularly lucrative offseason for shortstops. Xander Boegarts, Trea Turner and Dansby Swanson all struck it rich, too.</p><p>Minnesota made no secret of a strong desire to offer a contract like no other in the history of the midmarket franchise, with a $184 million, eight-year deal to extend catcher Joe Mauer in 2010 the previous record for amount and length. Twins players who were close to Correa kept in touch with the native of Puerto Rico, lobbying him to return.</p><p>The Twins had their limits, though. They acquired shortstop Kyle Farmer in a trade with the Reds for insurance at the position while top prospect Royce Lewis continues his recovery from a torn ACL expected to keep him out for at least the first half of this season.</p><p>New York has become baseball's biggest spender under Cohen, who bought the team before the 2021 season. Correa’s addition would have put New York on track for a luxury tax payroll and tax assessment of more than $500 million this year.</p><p>___</p><p>AP Sports Writer Dave Campbell in Minneapolis contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports </p>]]></description>

(AP) — Lynette Hardaway, an ardent supporter of former President Donald Trump and one half of the conservative political commentary duo Diamond and Silk, has died, according to the pair's Twitter account. She was 51.</p><p>Hardaway, known by the moniker “Diamond,” carved out a unique role as a Black woman who loudly backed Trump and right-wing policies, earning fame first on the Internet and then as a cable television commentator. Her promotion of COVID-19 falsities eventually got her dropped from Fox News, but she landed on another right-wing cable platform.</p><p>She and her sister, Rochelle “Silk” Richardson, rose to prominence during the 2016 presidential campaign cycle when they appeared on stage in support of Trump, who embraced the two Black women amid widespread <a href="https://apnews.com/article/3d3c821ad4984f74bc54c0f1b0b41705">accusations of racism</a> and sexism.</p><p>Hardaway's cause of death has not been released. Trump, who called her death “really bad news for Republicans” in a Monday night <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/109662467994681545">post on his Truth Social platform</a>, said it was “totally unexpected.”</p><p>“Our beautiful Diamond of Diamond and Silk has just passed away at her home in the State she loved so much, North Carolina," Trump wrote. “There was no better TEAM anywhere, at any time!”</p><div id="afs:Card:480774185258" content-id="7ba302111687a71e7686dad3b0f57a43" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (apf-trendingnews) - Compressed layout </div><p>The pair's verified Twitter account had asked people to “please pray for Diamond” in a <a href="https://twitter.com/DiamondandSilk/status/1596550190336512000?s=20&amp;t=UWkdchPhGUAoOLobATWTQw">November tweet</a> but did not elaborate on the circumstances.</p><p>“The World just lost a True Angel and Warrior Patriot for Freedom, Love, and Humanity," the <a href="https://twitter.com/DiamondandSilk/status/1612636233196355586">account wrote Monday night</a>, linking to a memorial fundraising page. </p><p>A memorial ceremony will be announced.</p><p>The sisters, who called themselves Trump's “most outspoken and loyal supporters,” have said they switched political parties to support his first presidential bid, in which he carried only about 8% of Black voters in the 2016 general election. He invited them to his inauguration in 2017 and, later, to the White House.</p><p>In the introduction to their co-written autobiography “Uprising,” published in 2020, the pair wrote that they faced criticism throughout the 2016 campaign cycle from people who called them “sellouts” and worse names as they stumped for Trump. They said their time in the spotlight wasn’t planned.</p><p>“We were just going along with our lives as usual, then we were thrust into this political arena all because we dared to speak out and speak up for what we believed,” they wrote.</p><p>Raised in the Tar Heel state, the two amassed a following of 347,000 subscribers on YouTube and leveraged their Internet stardom to land many network television appearances and regular roles at Fox News. </p><p>The network removed them from its list of contributors in 2020 after they came under fire for spreading false information about the pandemic and vaccines. The duo had falsely suggested the virus was man-made and that the rising death toll was a media conspiracy to make the Trump administration look bad. </p><p>Twitter briefly locked their account for violating its coronavirus misinformation policy after they tweeted the baseless claim that “quarantining people inside of their houses for extended periods will make people sick.”</p><p>Landing at Newsmax, a far-right cable news and digital media company, they hosted three seasons of their talk show “Diamond and Silk: Crystal Clear."</p><p>___</p><p>Hannah Schoenbaum is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

(Jan. 10)</p>    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee has requested that the U.S. intelligence community conduct a “damage assessment” of potentially <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-taiwan-biden-government-and-politics-mar-a-lago-2474104aa0fd9ffaa8de33538813c84e">classified documents found</a> in the Washington office space of President Joe Biden’s former institute,</p><p>Rep. Mike Turner sent the request Tuesday to Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, saying that Biden's retention of the documents put him in “potential violation of laws protecting national security, including the Espionage Act and Presidential Records Act.”</p><p>Irrespective of a federal review, the revelation that Biden potentially mishandled classified or presidential records could prove to be a political headache for the president, who called former President Donald Trump’s decision to keep hundreds of such records at his <a href="https://apnews.com/article/Irrespective%20of%20the%20Justice%20Department%20review,%20the%20revelation%20that%20Biden%20potentially%20mishandled%20classified%20or%20presidential%20records%20could%20prove%20to%20be%20a%20political%20headache%20for%20the%20president,%20who%20called%20Trump's%20decision%20to%20keep%20hundreds%20of%20such%20records%20at%20his%20private%20club%20in%20Florida%20%E2%80%9Cirresponsible.%22">private club in Florida “irresponsible.</a> ”</p><p>Biden ignored shouted questions about the matter Tuesday during a bilateral meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Mexico.</p><p>Turner's request came a day after the White House confirmed that the Department of Justice was reviewing “a small number of documents with classified markings." The documents were discovered as Biden's personal attorneys were clearing out the offices of the Penn Biden Center, where the president kept an office after he left the vice presidency in 2017 until shortly before he launched his presidential campaign in 2019, the White House said. </p><div id="afs:Card:130243251955" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="a45855907a73acb256bb7c4dd5a91610">Hub peek embed (JoeBiden) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“Those entrusted with access to classified information have a duty and an obligation to protect it,” said Turner in a letter to Haines. “This issue demands a full and thorough review.”</p><p>Sen. Mark Warner, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called for a briefing on the Biden documents.</p><p>“Our system of classification exists in order to protect our most important national security secrets, and we expect to be briefed on what happened both at Mar-a-Lago and at the Biden office as part of our constitutional oversight obligations," he said. "From what we know so far, the latter is about finding documents with markings, and turning them over, which is certainly different from a months-long effort to retain material actively being sought by the government. But again, that’s why we need to be briefed."</p><div id="71e25217d63244a0905832c8645bd802" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>The documents were found on Nov. 2, 2022, in a “locked closet” in the office, according to special counsel to the president Richard Sauber. </p><p>Sauber said the attorneys immediately alerted the White House Counsel's office, which notified the National Archives and Records Administration — which took custody of the documents the next day. </p><p>“Since that discovery, the President’s personal attorneys have cooperated with the Archives and the Department of Justice in a process to ensure that any Obama-Biden Administration records are appropriately in the possession of the Archives,” Sauber said. </p><p>A person who is familiar with the matter but not authorized to discuss it publicly said Attorney General Merrick Garland asked U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois John Lausch to review the matter after the Archives referred the issue to the department. Lausch is one of the few U.S. attorneys to be held over from Trump's administration. </p><p>Trump weighed in Monday on his social media site, asking, “When is the FBI going to raid the many homes of Joe Biden, perhaps even the White House?”</p><p>Republicans have just taken control of the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-us-republican-party-united-states-house-of-representatives-kevin-mccarthy-b9fcfd11427a695fe2eb49e36988f1a0">House of Representatives</a> and are promising to launch widespread investigations of Biden's administration.</p><p>The revelation also may complicate the Justice Department's consideration of whether to bring charges against Trump, who is trying to win back the White House in 2024 and has repeatedly claimed the department's inquiry into of his own conduct amounted to “corruption."</p><p>The National Archives did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. Spokespeople for Garland and Lausch declined to comment. </p><p>Rep. James Comer, the new GOP chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Monday that the revelation raised questions about the Justice Department’s handling of the Trump probe.</p><p>“Is the White House going to be raided tonight? Are they going to raid the Bidens?” he asked reporters. “This is further concern that there’s a two-tier justice system within the DOJ with how they treat Republicans versus Democrats, certainly how they treat the former president versus the current president.”</p><p>His Democratic counterpart, Rep. Jamie Raskin, said Biden's attorneys “appear to have taken immediate and proper action.”</p><p>“I have confidence that the attorney general took the appropriate steps to ensure the careful review of the circumstances surrounding the possession and discovery of these documents and make an impartial decision about any further action that may be needed,” he added.</p><p>Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, chair of the powerful House Judiciary Committee, said Monday that the American public deserved to know earlier about the classified documents.</p><p>“They knew about this a week before the election, maybe the American people should have known that,” Jordan told reporters. “They certainly knew about the the raid on Mar-a-Lago 91 days before this election, but nice if on November 2, the country would have known that there were classified documents at the Biden Center.”</p><p>Jordan is among House Republicans pushing for the creation of a “select subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal government” within the Judiciary Committee.</p><p>It wasn't immediately clear why the White House didn't disclose the discovery of the documents or the DOJ review sooner. CBS was first to report Monday on the discovery of the potentially classified documents.</p><p>The Justice Department for months has been investigating the retention of roughly 300 documents that were marked as classified and were recovered from the Trump's <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/mar-a-lago">Florida estate.</a> In that instance, prosecutors say, representatives of Trump resisted requests to give back the full stash of classified documents and failed to fully comply with a subpoena that sought their return.</p><p>FBI agents in August served a search warrant at the Mar-a-Lago property, removing 33 boxes and containers.</p><p>That investigation is being led by special counsel Jack Smith. Prosecutors have interviewed an array of Trump associates and have been using a grand jury to hear evidence.</p><p>Democrats made a similar request of the director of national intelligence in August following the search of Mar-a-Lago. Reps. Carolyn Maloney and Adam Schiff, who then led the House Oversight and Intelligence committees, asked Haines for an “immediate review and damage assessment,” alleging that Trump “has potentially put our national security at grave risk.”</p><p>Haines agreed in September to conduct a “risk assessment” instead, different from a formal “damage assessment” that carries specific requirements under intelligence regulations.</p><p>The risk assessment was to examine the documents seized at Mar-a-Lago for classification as well as “the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of the relevant documents.”</p><p>Intelligence officials are not believed to have briefed Congress on their assessment in the four months since, according to public statements from lawmakers. Haines noted in her letter that any risk assessment would not “unduly interfere” with the Justice Department’s criminal investigation into the documents seized at Mar-a-Lago.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Nomaan Merchant, Eric Tucker and Farnoush Amiri in Washington, Colleen Long in Mexico City and Michael Tarm in Chicago contributed.</p><p>This story was first published on Jan. 9, 2023. </p>]]></description>

Katie Porter of California said Tuesday she will seek the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Sen. <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/dianne-feinstein">Dianne Feinstein</a>, a fellow Democrat and the oldest member of the chamber. </p><p>“Especially in times like these, California needs a warrior in Washington," Porter said in a video posted on Twitter. “That's exactly why I'm announcing my candidacy for the United States Senate in 2024.” </p><p>Porter is a progressive Democrat who was first elected to Congress in 2018 and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-california-cd03ac6217b63f76c5a954961bf0fbf2">won a tight race for reelection</a> to her newly redrawn Southern California district in November. She said in the video that she has “challenged the status quo" in Washington, taking on “big banks,” Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry. She wants to ban members of Congress from stock trading. </p><p>“To win these fights, it's time for new leadership in the U.S. Senate," she said.</p><p>Feinstein, 89, has for several years faced questions about her health and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/confirmation-hearings-amy-coney-barrett-dianne-feinstein-elections-california-bef21dcb7dbc3d222dc6c95a165fff71">whether she will seek another term</a>. She has not announced whether she will seek reelection in 2024, though she is widely expected to retire.</p><p>“Everyone is of course welcome to throw their hat in the ring, and I will make an announcement concerning my plans for 2024 at the appropriate time," Feinstein, who won her sixth election in 2018 said in a statement Tuesday. She added that she is currently “focused on ensuring California has all the resources it needs” to deal with <a href="https://apnews.com/article/floods-weather-natural-disasters-landslides-and-mudslides-storms-21b103e791710f4af6ca0ce45c6030b5?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=TopNews&amp;utm_campaign=position_02">deadly storms hitting the state</a>.</p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="172759fa83faa0a70a2195a91dedb6f3">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Porter’s announcement, which came as torrential rains and mudslides forced thousands from their homes and were blamed for the deaths of over a dozen people, could be the start of a competitive race between multiple candidates in the heavily Democratic state. Republicans haven’t won a statewide race in California since 2006, and with Feinstein and Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer having their seats locked up for a quarter century, several Democrats have been waiting for their chance. </p><p>Among the potential candidates is Rep. Adam Schiff, who was a key figure in impeachment proceedings against former President Donald Trump and has said he's exploring a Senate run. Rep. Ro Khanna told NBC News on Tuesday that he is focused on “historic weather conditions” his district is facing and that he will make a decision “in the next few months.”</p><p>Feinstein was elected for the sixth time in 2018. Noticeably more frail than in previous years and occasionally forgetful when asked questions, she holds no senior leadership positions, makes fewer public appearances and is no longer the force she was in the Senate. She stepped down from her post as the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee in 2020 and also declined to take the post of Senate pro tempore this year after the retirement of Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy.</p><p>The Senate president pro tempore, third in line to the presidency, usually goes automatically to the most senior member of the majority party. As the de facto president of the Senate when the vice president is away, the president pro tempore has several jobs, including opening the Senate every day that it is in session.</p><p>While Feinstein is the most senior Senate Democrat, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer gave the post to Washington Sen. Patty Murray after Feinstein indicated she would not take it. In a statement released by a spokesman last year, she said “I’ve never thought about being the president pro tempore and I have no interest in it at this time.”</p><p>Feinstein also has seen pushback from Democrats who view her as too bipartisan at a time when politics is more polarized and her state is increasingly liberal. She was criticized in 2020 for being too friendly with Republicans during confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett. That included <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-confirmation-hearings-amy-coney-barrett-dianne-feinstein-voting-rights-366d70dcde6aa681e540dd6a0e3a25de">an embrace</a> of the Republican Chairman, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, at the conclusion of the hearings and kind words for what she called a job well done.</p><p>Feinstein has defended her performance and said in 2021 that she planned to serve her full term, even as there was open speculation and discussion about the future of the seat. Gov. Gavin Newson said in 2021 that he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/gavin-newsom-dianne-feinstein-california-351cb71e532c073f28d6d84465480cf6">would appoint a Black woman</a> to replace Feinstein, who's white, if she were to retire early.</p><p>Porter, 49, was a consumer protection attorney before her election to the House, and she has earned a reputation for her tough questioning of CEOs and other witnesses at congressional hearings — often using a whiteboard to break down information.</p><p>Porter's media savvy was again on display during the recent meltdown in the U.S. House over the election of a new speaker. As <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-kevin-mccarthy-matt-gaetz-florida-f2a4a42b4845f2413cca5c1b4c6100dd">Republicans argued</a>, Porter was seen sitting in the chamber, disinterestedly, reading a book on “the subtle art” of not caring about what's happening.</p><p>Porter also has been one of the top fundraisers in the House, having spent more than $24 million on her reelection to the House last year. The Tuesday announcement allows her to get a head start on banking money and securing donors' support. </p><p>Her opponent in the November House election, Republican Scott Baugh, said Tuesday that he will again run for the closely contested House district in 2024.</p><p>__</p><p>Burnett reported from Chicago.

They led to at least 474 deaths.</p><div id="afs:Card:714085214671" content-id="99e53454edecb6d286e979f46ceb8dcb" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (Climateandenvironment) - Compressed layout </div><p>“People are seeing the impacts of a changing climate system where they live, work and play on a regular basis,” NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad said at a Tuesday press conference. “With a changing climate buckle up. More extreme events are expected.”</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricanes-health-mental-fort-myers-natural-disasters-434f72c8db042bf074fb10b313b553b6">Hurricane Ian</a>, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-colorado-river-droughts-business-889078912d1428e91477c254228a92b1">costliest drought in a decade</a> and a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/winter-storm-forecast-updates-d0808da42ce16e8a0ca4541b747572cb">pre-Christmas winter storm</a> pushed last year's damages to the highest since 2017. The only more expensive years were 2017 — when Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria struck — and the disastrous 2005 when numerous hurricanes, headlined by Katrina, pummeled the Southeast, federal meteorologists said. The only busier years for billion-dollar disasters were 2020 and 2021.</p><p>Ian was the third-costliest U.S. hurricane on record with $112.9 billion in damage, followed by $22.2 billion in damage from a western and midwestern drought that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/louisiana-mississippi-missouri-river-us-army-corps-of-engineers-e65a5fd9371384593d6e1f9cf74e6444">halted barge traffic on the Mississippi River</a>, officials said. The $165 billion total for 2022 doesn’t even include a total yet for the winter storm three weeks ago, which could push it close to $170 billion, officials said.</p><p>More than 40% of the continental United States was under official drought conditions for 119 straight weeks, a record in the 22 years of the federal drought monitor, easily passing the old mark of 68 straight weeks, Spinrad said. The country peaked at 63% of the nation in drought in 2022. Spinrad said he expects the atmospheric river pouring rain on California to provide some relief, but not a lot.</p><p>“Climate change is supercharging many of these extremes that can lead to billion-dollar disasters,” said NOAA applied climatologist and economist Adam Smith, who calculates the disasters, updating them to factor out inflation. He said more people are also building in harm’s way, along pricey coasts and rivers, and lack of strong construction standards is also an issue. With a good chunk of development beachside, real estate inflation could be a small localized factor, he said.</p><p>“The United States has some of the consistently most diverse and intense weather and climate extremes that you’ll see in many parts of the world. And we have a large population that’s vulnerable to these extremes,” Smith told The Associated Press. “So it’s really an imbalance right now.” </p><p>Climate change is a hard-to-ignore factor in extremes, from deadly heat to droughts and flooding, Smith and other officials said.</p><p>“The risk of extreme events is growing and they are affecting every corner of the world,” NOAA chief scientist Sarah Kapnick said.</p><p>The problem is especially bad when it comes to dangerous heat, said NOAA climate scientist Stephanie Herring, who edits an annual study in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society that calculates how much of the extreme weather in past years <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/climate-attribution-tools-critical-for-understanding-extreme-events">was worsened by climate change</a>.</p><p>“Research is showing that these extreme heat events are also likely to become the new normal,” Herring said at the weather conference.</p><p>There’s been a dramatic upswing in the size and number of super costly extremes in the U.S. since about 2016, Smith said. In the past seven years, 121 different billion-dollar weather disasters have caused more than $1 trillion in damage and killed more than 5,000 people.</p><p>Those years dwarf what happened in the 1980s, 1990s or 2000s. For example, in the entire decade of the 1990s there were 55 different billion-dollar disasters that cost $313 billion total and claimed 3,062 lives.</p><p>“It’s not just one but many, many different types of extremes across much of the country,” Smith said. “If extremes were on a bingo card, we almost filled up the card over the last several years.”</p><p>In 2022, there were nine billion-dollar non-tropical storms, including a derecho, three hurricanes, two tornado outbreaks, one flood, one winter storm, a megadrought and costly wildfires. The only general type of weather disaster missing was an icy freeze that causes $1 billion or more in crop damage, Smith said. And last month, Florida came close to it, but missed it by a degree or two and some preventive steps by farmers, he said.</p><p>That prevented freeze was one of two “silver linings” in 2022 extremes, Smith said. The other was that the wildfire season, though still costing well over $1 billion, wasn’t as severe as past years, except in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/floods-wildfires-mountains-fires-new-mexico-1b4102ee2d1ab5c5a0af304df0cbf720">New Mexico</a> and Texas, he said.</p><p>For the first 11 months of 2022, California was going through its second-driest year on record, but drenchings from an <a href="https://apnews.com/article/floods-weather-storms-natural-disasters-california-4f9ac9733888a349bee3c38b44e0bfb3">atmospheric river</a> that started in December turned it to only the ninth-driest year on record for California, said NOAA climate monitoring chief Karin Gleason.</p><p>With a third straight year of a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/what-is-la-nina-drought-wildfires-hurricanes-619a4a1a928fdb80d301c7dca0c45dcf">La Nina</a> cooling the eastern Pacific, which tends to change weather patterns across the globe and moderate global warming, 2022 was only the 18th-warmest year in U.S. records, Gleason said.</p><p>“It was a warm year certainly above average for most of the country but nothing off the charts,” Gleason said. The nation’s average temperature was 53.4 degrees (11.9 degrees Celsius), which is 1.4 degrees (0.8 degrees) warmer than the 20th century average.</p><p>The year was 1.5 inches (3.8 centimeters) below normal for rain and snow, the 27th-driest out of 128 years, Gleason said.</p><p>NOAA and NASA on Thursday will announce how hot the globe was for 2022, which won't be a record but is likely to be in the top seven or so hottest years. European climate monitoring group Copernicus released its calculations Tuesday, saying 2022 was the fifth-hottest globally and second-hottest in Europe.</p><p>U.S. greenhouse gas emissions — which is what traps heat to cause global warming — rose 1.3% in 2022, according to a report released Tuesday by the Rhodium Group, a think tank. That's less than the economy grew. The emissions increase was driven by cars, trucks and industry with electric power generation polluting slightly less.</p><p>It's the second straight year, both after lockdowns eased, that American carbon pollution has grown after fairly steady decreases for several years. It makes it less likely that the United States will achieve <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-climate-change-science-climate-environment-and-nature-bdcf107d1fd146c2136f132b9fd13861">its pledge</a> to cut carbon emissions in half by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, according to the Rhodium report.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP’s climate and environment coverage at <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment">https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment</a></p><p>___</p><p>Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/borenbears">@borenbears</a></p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

If that forecast proves accurate, it would be the third-weakest annual expansion in three decades, behind only the deep recessions that resulted from the 2008 global financial crisis and the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. </p><p>Though the United States might avoid <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-covid-health-economy-d2fd0bbc09fbe98d8fdb4840be29e826">a recession</a> this year — the World Bank predicts the U.S. economy will eke out growth of 0.5% — global weakness will likely pose another headwind for America's businesses and consumers, on top of high prices and more expensive borrowing rates. The United States also remains vulnerable to further <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-health-inflation-prices-0e1c4f759008207e255beb128dcc5cbe">supply chain disruptions</a> if COVID-19 keeps surging or Russia's war in Ukraine worsens. </p><p>And Europe, long a major exporter to China, will likely suffer from a weaker Chinese economy. </p><p>The World Bank report also noted that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-business-9b2bb41058476b14b36a4acf98e3baed">rising interest rates</a> in developed economies like the United States and Europe will attract investment capital from poorer countries, thereby depriving them of crucial domestic investment. At the same time, the report said, those high interest rates will slow growth in developed countries at a time when <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine">Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a> has kept world food prices high.</p><div id="afs:Card:637751272987" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="391bd23625e205a0d94c1d1c224892a8">Hub peek embed (apf-europe) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has added major new costs,” World Bank President David Malpass said on a call with reporters. “The outlook is particularly devastating for many of the poorest economies where poverty reduction is already ground to a halt and access to electricity, fertilizer, food and capital is likely to remain limited for a prolonged period.”</p><p>The impact of a global downturn would fall particularly hard on poorer countries in such areas as Saharan Africa, which is home to 60% of the world's poor. The World Bank predicts per capita income will grow just 1.2% in 2023 and 2024, which is such a tepid pace that poverty rates could rise.</p><p>“Weakness in growth and business investment will compound the already devastating reversals in education, health, poverty and infrastructure and the increasing demands from climate change,” Malpass said. “Addressing the scale of these challenges will require significantly more resources for development and global public goods."</p><p>Along with seeking new financing so it can lend more to poorer countries, Malpass said, the World Bank is, among other things, seeking to improve its lending terms that would increase debt transparency, “especially for the rising share of poor countries that are at high risk of debt distress."</p><p>The report follows a similarly gloomy forecast a week earlier from Kristina Georgieva, the head of the International Monetary Fund, the global lending agency. Georgieva estimated on CBS' “Face the Nation” that one-third of the world will fall into recession this year. </p><p>“For most of the world economy, this is going to be a tough year, tougher than the year we leave behind,” Georgieva said. “Why? Because the three big economies — U.S., EU, China — are all slowing down simultaneously.”</p><p>The World Bank projects that the European Union's economy won't grow at all next year after having expanded 3.3% in 2022. It foresees China growing 4.3%, nearly a percentage point lower than it had previously forecast and about half the pace that Beijing posted in 2021. </p><p>The bank expects developing countries to fare better, growing 3.4% this year, the same as in 2022, though still only about half the pace of 2021. It forecasts Brazil's growth slowing to 0.8% in 2023, down from 3% last year. In Pakistan, it expects the economy to expand just 2% this year, one-third of last year's pace. </p><p>Other economists have also issued bleak outlooks, though most of them not quite as dire. Economists at JPMorgan are predicting slow growth this year for advanced economies and the world as a whole, but they don't expect a global recession. Last month, the bank predicted that slowing inflation will bolster consumers' ability to spend and power growth in the United States and elsewhere. </p><p>“The global expansion will turn into 2023 bent but not broken,” the JPMorgan report said. </p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press reporter Fatima Hussein contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

He was also fined $1 million and sentenced to 2.5 years for currency smuggling.</p><p>Under Iranian law, Vandecasteele would be eligible for release after 12.5 years. The judiciary website said the verdicts can be appealed.</p><p>Iran has detained a number of foreigners and dual nationals over the years, accusing them of espionage or other state security offenses and sentencing them after secretive trials in which rights groups say they are denied due process. Critics accuse Iran of using such prisoners as bargaining chips with the West, something Iranian officials deny.</p><p>Iran has not released any details about the charges against Vandecasteele. It is unclear if they are related to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-morality-police-explainer-b53475eda867a4158ac5032fe1b3e62e">anti-government protests</a> that have convulsed Iran for months or <a href="https://apnews.com/article/50c3e7f6445ae99def6bdc65fbce6c42">a long-running shadow war</a> with Israel and the U.S. marked by covert attacks on Iran's disputed nuclear program.</p><div id="afs:Card:445811840848" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="5ae7ee103dc4cf4e06cccf7b77c6a59c">Hub peek embed (Iran) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>The nationwide protests began after the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was detained for allegedly violating Iran's strict Islamic dress code. Rallying under the slogan “Women, life, freedom,” the protesters say they are fed up with decades of social and political repression. Iran has blamed the protests on foreign powers, without providing evidence.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Vandecasteele's family said last month that he has been detained in an Iranian prison for months and has been on a hunger strike. They said he was deprived of access to a lawyer of his choice and is suffering from serious health problems.</p><p>Belgium <a href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-prisons-3a5d5e6d70fb654ff1829100a32ef87c">has urged its nationals to leave Iran</a>, warning that they face the risk of arbitrary arrest or unfair trial.</p><p>“Iran has provided no official information regarding the charges against Olivier Vandecasteele or his trial,” Belgium's Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib said in a statement. “We will summon the Iranian ambassador today, given the information that is circulating in the press.”</p><p>“Belgium continues to condemn this arbitrary detention and is doing everything possible to put an end to it and to improve the conditions of his detention,” she said.</p><p>The protests, which have continued for nearly four months with no sign of ending, mark one of the biggest challenges to the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution that brought it to power.</p><p>At least 520 protesters have been killed and more than 19,300 people have been arrested since the demonstrations began, according to Human Rights Activists in Iran, a group that has been monitoring the unrest. Iranian authorities have not provided official figures on deaths or arrests.</p><p>Iran has executed four people after convicting them of charges linked to the protests, including attacks on security forces. They were also convicted in Revolutionary Courts, which do not allow those on trial to pick their own lawyers or see the evidence against them. </p><p>London-based Amnesty International has said such trials bear “no resemblance to a meaningful judicial proceeding."</p><p>Norway and Denmark summoned Iranian ambassadors this week to protest the executions and Iran's handling of the demonstrations.</p><p>"What is happening in Iran is completely unacceptable and must stop," Norway’s Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt said. “We have strongly condemned the executions. ... We have called on Iran to end the use of the death penalty and to respect human rights.”</p><p>In Denmark, Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen called the executions “completely unacceptable" and said the European Union should impose additional sanctions on Iran.</p><p>Separately on Tuesday, the state-run IRNA news agency said Iran’s intelligence ministry arrested six teams of operatives linked to Mossad, Israel's chief intelligence and secret-service agency. </p><p>Without providing evidence, the report said the spy teams planned to assassinate an unnamed high-ranking military official and had carried out several sabotage operations in the country’s big cities.</p><p>The report also said security forces identified 23 alleged members of these teams and had arrested 13 of them who were in the country.</p>]]></description>

The final Potter book, “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows," sold more than 2.5 million copies on its first day of release, in 2007.</p><p>A few stores in Britain opened at midnight to sell copies to diehard royal devotees and the merely curious. Many said they wanted to form their own opinion of the book after days of snippets and debate on news sites and television.</p><p>“I’m excited just to hear about Prince Harry’s life from Prince Harry,” said Sarah Nakana, a surveyor who bought the book at London’s Victoria station. “There’s so much misinformation, disinformation about Harry and Meghan.”</p><p>The book’s myriad <a href="https://apnews.com/article/prince-harry-spare-book-revelations-0f60db708cfc266e247c1efa7c98877b">revelations and accusations</a> have already been splashed across the media.

Harry’s interview with broadcaster ITV drew 4.1 million viewers on Sunday — fewer than the 5.3 million who watched BBC drama “Happy Valley” at the same time.</p><p>Retail worker Caroline Lennon arrived at 6 a.m. Tuesday at a branch of Waterstones in central London to await its opening.</p><p>“I did expect a queue. Unfortunately, there’s no queue. I’m just by myself,” she said.</p><p>“I want to read (it) because I like the royal family and I don’t care what anybody says,” she said. “People will criticize that. I don’t care because I like the royal family, and I like Harry and Meghan.”</p><p>_____</p><p>AP National Writer Hillel Italie contributed to this report from New York.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>POMPEII, Italy (AP) — The newly restored remains of an opulent house in Pompeii that likely belonged to two former slaves who became rich through the wine trade offer visitors an exceptional peek at details of domestic life in the doomed Roman city.</p><p>On Tuesday, the House of Vettii, Domus Vettiorum in Latin, was being formally unveiled after 20 years of restoration. Given fresh life were frescoes from the latest fashion in Pompeii wall decoration before the flourishing city was buried under the volcanic ash furiously spewing from Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. </p><p>The unveiling of the restored home is yet another sign of the rebirth of Pompeii, which followed decades of modern bureaucratic neglect, flooding and pillaging by thieves in search of artifacts to sell.</p><p>That is delighting tourists and rewarding experts with tantalizing fresh insights into the everyday life of what is one of the most celebrated remnants of the ancient world.</p><p>“The House of the Vetti is like the history of Pompeii and actually of Roman society within one house,” Pompeii’s director, Gabriel Zuchtriegel, gushed as he showed off an area of the domus known as the Cupid Rooms last month.</p><p>“We’re seeing here the last phase of the Pompeian wall painting with incredible details, so you can stand before these images for hours and still discover new details,” the archaeological park’s energetic director told The Associated Press ahead of the public inauguration. </p><div id="afs:Card:958899307023" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="4f7d78b61fb39b5fd3f71cd07ff3eded">Hub peek embed (apf-entertainment) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“So, you have this mixture: nature, architecture, art. But it is also a story about the social life of the Pompeiian society and actually the Roman world in this phase of history," Zuchtriegel added.</p><p>Previous restoration work, which involved repeated application of paraffin over the frescoed walls in hopes of preserving them, “resulted in them becoming very blurred over time, because very thick and opaque layers formed, making it difficult to ‘read’ the fresco," said Stefania Giudice, director of fresco restoration.</p><p>But the wax did serve to preserve them remarkably. </p><p>Zuchtriegel ventured that the fresh “readings” of the revived fresco painting “reflect the dreams and imagination and anxieties of the owners because they lived between these images,’’ which include Greek mythological figures.</p><p>And who were these owners? The Vettis were two men — Aulus Vettius Conviva and Aulus Vettius Restitutus. In addition to having part of their names in common, they shared a common past — not as descendants of noble Roman families accustomed to opulence, but rather, Pompeii experts say, almost certainly, as once enslaved men who were later freed.</p><p>It is believed that they became wealthy through the wine trade. While some have hypothesized the two were brothers, there is no certainty about that.</p><p>In the living room, known as the Hall of Pentheus, a fresco depicts Hercules as a child, crushing two snakes, in an illustration of an episode from the Greek hero’s life. According to mythology, Hera, the goddess wife of Zeus, sent snakes to kill Hercules because she was furious that he was born from the union of Zeus with a mortal woman, Alcmena.</p><p>Might Aulus Vettius Conviva and Aulus Vettius Restitutus have recognized their own life story in some way in the figure of Hercules who overcame challenge after challenge in his life?</p><p>That's a question that intrigues Zuchtriegel.</p><p>After years in slavery, the men “then had an incredible career after that and reached the highest ranks of local society, at least economically,’’ judging by their upscale domus and garden, Zuchtriegel said. “They evidently tried to show their new status also through culture and through Greek mythological paintings, and it’s all about saying, ‘We’ve made it and so we are part of this elite’” of the Roman world.</p><p>Pompeii’s architect director of restoration work, Arianna Spinosa, called the restored home “one of the iconic houses of Pompeii. The residence "represents the Pompeiian domus par excellence, not only because of the frescoes of exceptional importance, but also because of its layout and architecture.”</p><p>Ornamental marble baths and tables surround the garden.</p><p>First unearthed during archaeological excavations in the late 19th century, the domus was closed in 2002 for urgent restoration work, including shoring up roofing. After a partial reopening in 2016, it was closed again in 2020 for the final phase of the work, which included restoration of the frescoes and of the floor and colonnades. </p>]]></description>

Despite the low profile of the payment plan, however, some education experts see it as a more powerful tool to make college affordable, especially for those with lower incomes.</p><p>Education Department officials on Tuesday called the new plan a “student loan safety net" that will prevent borrowers from getting overloaded with debt.</p><p>“Student debt has become a dream killer,” Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said. “This is a promise to the American people that, at long last, we will fix a broken system and make student loans affordable.”</p><p>Biden, a Democrat, is moving forward with the repayment plan even as his one-time debt cancellation faces <a href="https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-student-loan-cancellation-79f7530363c7f15166d8c9cda3a6cddb">an uncertain fate before the Supreme Court</a>. The White House has asked the court to uphold the plan and reject two legal challenges from conservative opponents. The Biden administration submitted its brief last week, with oral arguments slated for Feb. 28.</p><div id="afs:Card:130243251955" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="73dcbf54ddb3b53c9c3c5468cfdec3b9">Hub peek embed (JoeBiden) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>The Education Department formally proposed the new repayment plan on Tuesday by publishing it in the Federal Register, starting a public comment period that often takes months to navigate.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>If it's finalized, the proposal would give a major overhaul to income-driven repayment plans — one of several payment options offered by the federal government. The resulting plan would have lower monthly payments, an easier path to forgiveness and a promise that unpaid interest will not be added to a borrower’s loan balance.</p><p>The federal government now offers four types of income-driven plans, but the proposal would mostly phase out three of them while focusing on one simplified option, scaling back the confusing array of options borrowers now face.</p><p>Under existing plans, monthly payments are capped at 10% of a borrower’s discretionary income, and those earning less than $20,400 a year aren’t required to make payments. The new proposal would cap payments for undergraduate loans at 5% of borrowers’ discretionary pay, cutting their bills in half, and require payments only for those who earn more than about $30,000 a year.</p><p>As long as borrowers make their monthly payments, any unpaid interest would not be charged. The change is meant to prevent borrowers from having unpaid interest added to their loan balance, a practice that can cause debt to snowball even as borrowers make payments.</p><p>Significantly, the proposal would also make it easier to get debt erased after making several years of payments. Existing plans promise to cancel any remaining debt after 20 or 25 years of payments. The new plan would erase all remaining debt after 10 years for those who took out $12,000 or less in loans. For every $1,000 borrowed beyond that, a year would be added.</p><p>Typical graduates of a four-year university would save about $2,000 a year compared with today’s plans, the Biden administration says, while 85% of community college borrowers would be debt-free within 10 years.</p><p>Supporters see the proposal as a significant stride toward college affordability. Some say it’s so generous that it approaches free community college — a campaign promise that Biden has pushed but failed to deliver.</p><p>The Institute for College Access and Success, a nonprofit organization that promotes college affordability, praised the proposal as a significant improvement over existing plans.</p><p>“The changes proposed today would provide meaningful financial relief to millions of borrowers and help shield students from debt that has not paid off, including those who start college but do not complete a degree,” said Sameer Gadkaree, the group's president.</p><p>Opponents on the right blast the revamped plan as an unfair handout with a steep price tag. The Biden administration estimates the repayment plan would cost nearly $138 billion over the decade, and some critics have put it closer to $200 billion.</p><p>Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx, chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, said the proposal turns the federal loan program into "an untargeted grant with complete disregard for the taxpayers that fund it.”</p><p>“Because President Biden couldn’t get his radical free college agenda through Congress, he has resorted to doing it through the backdoor by executive fiat,” Foxx said in a statement.</p><p>Even some on the left have questioned the prudence of the idea, saying it's so generous that it effectively turns student loans into grants that don’t need to be repaid. That could lead more students to borrow, they warn, and it could spur colleges to raise tuition prices if they know students won’t be on the hook.</p><p>Still others have urged the administration to abandon income-driven payment plans entirely, calling them a failed policy. Critics cite <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-education-6ce97ddc9db7f777e8e6fb2d7a8fb2cd">a federal report from last year</a> finding that sloppy oversight of the program left thousands of borrowers stuck with debt that should have been forgiven.</p><p>Cardona said his agency is working on other proposals that would hold colleges accountable if their students get overburdened with debt. One idea promoted by Biden is to warn the public about programs that leave graduates saddled with debt.</p><p>The Education Department on Tuesday began the process to deliver that goal, asking the public about the best way to identify “low-value” programs.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press education team receives support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York.

(AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian forces are escalating their onslaught against Ukrainian positions around the wrecked city of Bakhmut, Ukrainian officials said, bringing new levels of death and devastation in the grinding, monthslong battle for control of eastern Ukraine that is part of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-moscow-religion-orthodox-church-9bea8791e5eda36a0b01cb3b6da86bd5">Moscow's wider war</a>.</p><p>“Everything is completely destroyed. There is almost no life left,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said late Monday of the scene around Bakhmut and the nearby Donetsk province city of Soledar.</p><p>“The whole land near Soledar is covered with the corpses of the occupiers and scars from the strikes,” Zelenskyy said. “This is what madness looks like.”</p><p>The Kremlin, whose invasion of its neighbor 10 1/2 months ago has suffered numerous reversals, is hungry for victories. Russia illegally annexed Donetsk and three other Ukrainian provinces in September, but <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-iran-biden-education-jake-sullivan-886376045d35f9bb7bb96cc0d18a7869">its troops have struggled</a> to advance.</p><p>After Ukrainian forces recaptured the southern city of Kherson in November, the battle heated up around Bakhmut.</p><p>Ukraine's deputy defense minister, Hanna Malyar, said Russia has thrown “a large number of storm groups” into the fight for the city. “The enemy is advancing literally on the bodies of their own soldiers and is massively using artillery, rocket launchers and mortars, hitting their own troops,” she said.</p><div id="afs:Card:521103274690" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="1643b607f7424aa58637514c59e22b35">Hub peek embed (Russia-Ukraine) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Pavlo Kyrylenko, the Donetsk region's Kyiv-appointed governor, on Tuesday described the Russian attacks on Soledar and Bakhmut as relentless. </p><p>“The Russian army is reducing Ukrainian cities to rubble using all kinds of weapons in their scorched-earth tactics,” Kyrylenko said in televised remarks. “Russia is waging a war without rules, resulting in civilian deaths and suffering.”</p><p>Wounded soldiers arrive around the clock for emergency treatment at a Ukrainian medical stabilization center near the front line around Bakhmut. Medics fought for 30 minutes Monday to save a soldier, but his injuries were too severe.</p><p>Another soldier suffered a head injury after a fragment pierced his helmet. Medics quickly stabilized him enough to transfer him to a military hospital.</p><p>“We fight to the end to save a life,” Kostyantyn Vasylkevich, a surgeon and the center’s coordinator, told The Associated Press. “Of course, it hurts when it is not possible to save them.”</p><p>The Moscow-backed leader of the occupied areas of Donetsk said Tuesday that Russia's forces were “very close” to taking over Soledar. But the gains were coming “at a very high price," Denis Pushilin told Russian state TV.</p><p>Control over the city would create “good prospects” for taking over Bakhmut, as well as Siversk, a town further north where <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-military-technology-ukraine-government-russia-war-2d59aae94a7ad8a5c22083e77d699417">Ukrainian fortifications</a> "are also quite serious,” Pushilin said. </p><p>The U.K. Defense Ministry concurred with that appraisal of the battle developments. Russian troops alongside soldiers from the Wagner Group, a Russian private military contractor, have advanced in Soledar and “are likely in control of most of the settlement,” the ministry tweeted Tuesday.</p><p>It said that taking Soledar, 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of Bakhmut, was likely Moscow’s immediate military objective and part of a strategy to encircle Bakhmut. But it added that “Ukrainian forces maintain stable defensive lines in depth and control over supply routes” in the area.</p><p>The Wagner Group’s leader, Dmitry Prigozhin, confirmed in a post on a Russian social media platform Tuesday that his forces are fighting in the area and acknowledged “heavy battles” in Soledar against a Ukrainian army he said “bravely fights.”</p><p>A Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Wagner Group “has moved from being a niche sideshow of Russia’s war to a major component of the conflict,” adding that its forces now make up as much as a quarter of Russian combatants.</p><p>An exceptional feature of the fighting near Bakhmut is that some of it has taken place around entrances to disused salt mine tunnels which run for some 200 kilometers (120 miles), the British intelligence report noted.</p><p>“Both sides are likely concerned that (the tunnels) could be used for infiltration behind their lines,” it said.</p><p>In Russia, two signs emerged Tuesday that officials were grappling with the military shortcomings revealed during the conflict in Ukraine. </p><p>Russian Defense Minister Shoigu, whose performance has been fiercely criticized in some Russian circles but who has retained Russian President Vladimir Putin’s confidence, said Tuesday that his military would use its experience in Ukraine to improve combat training. </p><p>Military communications and control systems will be improved using artificial intelligence, Shoigu said, and troops will be given better tactical gear and equipment.</p><p>The second indication of trouble involves Russia's production of weapons and other supplies its military needs for the fight in Ukraine. The deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, warned that officials who failed to meet deadlines for such items could face criminal charges. </p><p>Putin appointed Medvedev last month to head a new commission tasked with trying to solve the military's supply problems. Numerous reports have suggested Russia is running low on certain weapons and was sending some troops into battle with insufficient equipment and clothing. </p><p>Part of the Kremlin's challenge is keeping up with the weapons and supplies that Western allies are providing to Ukraine. </p><p>The Patriot surface-to-air guided missile defense system is one of the weapons Ukraine is about to receive, and the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-politics-6bb6e815e77b0d6b83590d344eb884bb">Pentagon announced Tuesday</a> that about 100 Ukrainian troops will head to Oklahoma’s Fort Sill as soon as next week to begin training on it. That will help Ukraine protect itself against Russian missile attacks. The United States pledged one Patriot battery last month, and Germany has pledged an additional system.</p><p>Germany's foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, announced Tuesday while visiting Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv, that her country would also provide 40 million euros ($43 million) to help with demining, energy infrastructure and internet connections, German news agency dpa reported. </p><p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-ukraine-russia-war-moscow-9b3a132b330c90a10e8f031113be241b">NATO members</a> “have become a party to the conflict, pumping weapons, technology and intelligence data into Ukraine.”</p><p>Several front-line cities in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk provinces have witnessed intense fighting in recent months.</p><p>Together, the provinces make up the Donbas, a broad industrial region bordering Russia that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-politics-government-milorad-dodik-7edc18d0133bbde4c5b84879c0dbe724">Putin</a> identified as a focus from the war’s outset and where Moscow-backed separatists have fought since 2014.</p><p>Russia’s grinding eastern offensive captured almost all of Luhansk during the summer. Donetsk escaped the same fate, and the Russian military subsequently poured manpower and resources around Bakhmut.</p><p>Taking Bakhmut would disrupt Ukraine’s supply lines and open a route for Russian forces to press toward Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, key Ukrainian strongholds in Donetsk. </p><p>Like Mariupol and other contested cities, Bakhmut endured a long siege without water and power even before Moscow launched massive strikes to take out public utilities across Ukraine. </p><p>Kyrylenko, the Donetsk region’s governor, estimated more than two months ago that 90% of Bakhmut’s prewar population of over 70,000 had fled since Moscow focused on seizing the entire Donbas.</p><p>Ukraine’s presidential office said at least four civilians were killed and another 30 wounded in Russian shelling between Monday and Tuesday.</p><p>Vitaliy Kim, the governor of the southern Mykolaiv region, said Russian forces shelled the port of Ochakiv and the area around it late Monday and again early Tuesday. He said 15 people, including a 2-year-old child, were wounded.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP’s coverage of the war at <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine">https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine</a></p>]]></description>

Thousands have been ordered to evacuate their homes.</p><p>At least 15 people have died from storms that began late last month, state officials said. But the official death toll did not include a 5-year-old boy who disappeared Monday in floodwaters or two people killed Tuesday when lightning knocked a tree onto a big rig on a San Joaquin Valley highway, causing a deadly pileup.</p><p>The storm that began Monday dumped more than a foot of rain at higher elevations in central and Southern California and buried Sierra Nevada ski resorts in more than a 5 feet (1.5 meters) of snow.</p><p>Rockfalls and mudslides shut down roads, and gushing runoff turned sections of freeways into waterways. Swollen rivers swamped homes and triggered evacuation orders.</p><p>Residents of the small agricultural community of Planada, which is along a main highway leading to Yosemite National Park, were ordered Tuesday to pack up and leave after Bear Creek overflowed and flooded some homes.</p><p>A break in the weather Tuesday on the central coast allowed searchers near San Miguel to look for Kyle Doan, the child who vanished after he and his mother were stranded in a truck in rising waters. His mother was rescued, but Kyle was swept away, and a seven-hour search Monday turned up only one of his Nike shoes.</p><p>“It’s still very dangerous out there," said San Luis Obispo County sheriff’s spokesperson Tony Cipolla. "The creeks are very fast flowing.”</p><p>The wet and blustery weather left California's large homeless population in a precarious situation. At least one homeless person has died, and more than a dozen people were rescued from a homeless encampment on the Ventura River.</p><p>Theo Harris, who has been living on the streets of San Francisco since getting out of jail in 2016, fortified his shelter with tarps and zip ties and took in his girlfriend after her tent flooded.</p><p>“The wind has been treacherous, but you just got to bundle up and make sure you stay dry," Harris said. “Rain is part of life. It’s going to be sunny. It’s going to rain. I just got to strap my boots up and not give up."</p><p>While the storms have provided much-needed moisture to offset a withering drought, their fury and frequency have created trouble that is expected to last into next week.</p><p>The latest atmospheric rivers — long plumes of moisture stretching out into the Pacific that can drop staggering amounts of rain and snow — began easing in some areas. But flooding and mudslides could follow, even during a brief respite, because the ground remains saturated.</p><p>More rain was forecast to arrive Wednesday in Northern California, and then a longer storm system was predicted to last from Friday until Tuesday, Jan. 17.</p><p>The weather service issued a flood watch through Tuesday for the entire San Francisco Bay Area, along with the Sacramento Valley and Monterey Bay. Areas hit by wildfires in recent years faced the possibility of mud and debris sliding down bare hillsides.</p><div id="afs:Card:959166249438" content-id="21b103e791710f4af6ca0ce45c6030b5" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (Floods) - Compressed layout (automatic embed)</div><p>Forecasters warned that southwestern California could see 60 mph (97 kph) wind gusts at the peak of the storm, and some areas could receive up to a half-inch (1.27 centimeters) of rain per hour. Tornadoes that had been forecast never materialized.</p><p>In South San Francisco, high winds ripped part of the roof off a large apartment building.</p><p>The squalls and flooding have forced school cancellations in some communities and intermittently shut down sections of major roadways that have flooded and turned into gushing rivers or been blocked by trees, rocks and landslides.</p><p>Sinkholes swallowed up two cars on a Los Angeles street, trapping two motorists who were rescued and damaging 15 homes in the rural Santa Barbara County community of Orcutt.</p><p>In Montecito, 80 miles (128 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles, about 10,000 people were ordered to evacuate the seaside community that is home to Prince Harry, Oprah Winfrey and other celebrities on the <a href="https://apnews.com/60bdabd547a540b0b72da785739a9033/8-dead-in-Southern-California-as-rain-triggers-mudslides">fifth anniversary of a mudslide</a> that killed 23 people and destroyed more than 100 homes.</p><p>Several miles down the coast another town, La Conchita in Ventura County, was ordered evacuated. A mudslide killed 10 people there in 2005.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press journalists John Antczak and Stefanie Dazio in Los Angeles and Janie Har and Olga R.

Two Romanian women also were taken into custody. </p><p>The Bucharest Court of Appeal late Tuesday rejected all four appeals against a judge's Dec. 30 decision to grant prosecutors' request to extend the arrest period. A document explaining the judge’s earlier decision said “the possibility of them evading investigations cannot be ignored,” and that they could “leave Romania and settle in countries that do not allow extradition.”</p><p>Tate and the other three defendants arrived at the Bucharest court in handcuffs Tuesday morning and were taken away in the afternoon, hours before the court ruled against them.</p><div id="afs:Card:827068831206" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="120e3499f9d9a0165517773ca40b40ed">Hub peek embed (Crime) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>After Tate lost his appeal, a cryptic post on his Twitter account read: “When Allah said ‘I test only those I love.’ I took the pain like it was an honour — Abu Hurayrah.” It was one of several ambiguous posts that appeared on the account since his arrest.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Tate, a former professional kickboxer who has reportedly lived in Romania since 2017, was previously banned from various prominent social media platforms for expressing misogynistic views and hate speech. The week of his arrest, he traded insults on Twitter with teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg.</p><p>DIICOT said it had identified six victims in the trafficking case who were subjected to “acts of physical violence and mental coercion” and were sexually exploited by the members of the alleged crime group.</p><p>The agency said victims were lured by pretenses of love, and later intimidated, kept under surveillance and subjected to other control tactics while being coerced into performing pornographic acts that were intended to make money for their alleged persecutors.</p><p>Prosecutors investigating the case have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/romania-government-bucharest-business-crime-3458065c0350ec217a21c627f725272c">seized 15 luxury cars</a>, at least seven of which were owned by the Tate brothers, and more than 10 properties or land owned by companies registered to them, DIICOT spokesperson Bolla said.</p><p>Bolla said that if prosecutors can prove the Tates gained money through human trafficking, the assets "will be taken by the state and (will) cover the expenses of the investigation and damages to the victims.”</p><p>After the appeals court upheld the arrest warrant extension, prosecutors can now request detentions of up to 180 days for the four people charged.</p><p>Since Tate’s arrest, a series of ambiguous posts have appeared on his Twitter account. Each tweet garners widespread media attention.</p><p>One, posted Sunday and accompanied by a Romanian report suggesting he or his brother have required medical care since their arrests, read: “The Matrix has attacked me. But they misunderstand, you cannot kill an idea. Hard to Kill.”</p><p>Another post, from Saturday, read: “Going to jail when guilty of a crime is the life story of a criminal … going to jail when completely innocent is the story of a hero.”</p><p>Hope not Hate, a U.K. advocacy group, said it monitored Tate for years “because of his close links to the far right.” It described the influencer in a report it produced last year as an “extreme misogynist” who holds conspiratorial views.</p><p>“Our major concern is that his brand of extreme and sometimes violent misogyny is reaching a young male audience and that he could serve as a gateway to wider far-right politics,” Hope not Hate said in a statement after Tate was banned by Facebook parent company Meta in August.</p><p>___</p><p>McGrath contributed from Sighisoara, Romania.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/John Minchillo)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Allen Weisselberg, a longtime executive for <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> ’s business empire, was taken into custody Tuesday to begin serving a five-month jail term for dodging taxes on $1.7 million in job perks — a punishment the judge who sentenced him said was probably too lenient for a case “driven entirely by greed.”</p><p>Weisselberg, 75, was promised the short sentence in August when he agreed to plead guilty to 15 tax crimes and to be a witness against the Trump Organization, where he worked since the mid-1980s. His testimony helped convict the former president’s company, where he had served as chief financial officer, of tax fraud.</p><p>But when he made the sentence official Tuesday, Judge Juan Manuel Merchan said that after listening to Weisselberg's trial testimony, he regretted that the penalty wasn't tougher. He said he was especially appalled by testimony that Weisselberg gave his wife a $6,000 check for a no-show job so that she could qualify for Social Security benefits.</p><p>Had he not already promised to give Weisselberg five months, Merchan said, “I would be imposing a sentence much greater than that.”</p><p>“I’m not going to deviate from the promise, though I believe a stiffer sentence is warranted, having heard the evidence,” he added.</p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="ad4cfbc71bb696b9a3fa6343de393613">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Weisselberg, who came to court dressed for jail rather than in his usual suit, was handcuffed and taken away by court officers moments after the sentence was announced. He was taken to New York City’s notorious Rikers Island complex, where he was expected to be housed in an infirmary unit. He will be eligible for release after little more than three months if he behaves behind bars.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Weisselberg's sentencing also marked the end of his career at the Trump Organization, where he had been on leave since the fall, continuing to make $1.14 million in salary and bonuses, even as he was testifying against the company. His lawyer, Nicholas Gravante, said that as of Tuesday, the executive and the company “have amicably parted ways.”</p><p>As part of the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/allen-weisselberg-trump-cfo-plea-deal-e36dbd47ee3b0323e1fa102117718011">plea agreement</a>, Weisselberg was required to pay nearly $2 million in back taxes, penalties and interest, which prosecutors said he has done. Prosecutors recommended a six-month jail sentence, but Merchan said he settled on five months, in part because of mitigating factors, such as Weisselberg’s military service and stint as a public school teacher. In addition, Merchan ordered Weisselberg to complete five years of probation after his leaves jail.</p><p>Gravante had asked the judge for an even lighter sentence than the one in the plea bargain, citing Weisselberg’s age and “far from perfect health."</p><p>“He has already been punished tremendously by the disgrace that he has brought not only on himself, but his wife, his sons and his grandchildren," Gravante said.</p><p>Weisselberg faced the prospect of up to 15 years in prison — the maximum punishment for the top grand larceny charge — if he were to have reneged on his deal or if he didn’t testify truthfully at the Trump Organization’s trial. Weisselberg is the only person charged in the Manhattan district attorney’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-new-york-manhattan-donald-trump-government-and-politics-af8c8d828e224dcde9b39ae17cbb3a4c">three-year investigation of Trump and his business practices</a>.</p><p>Weisselberg testified for three days, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-new-york-manhattan-donald-trump-c34f862954f07da374468d92633b2a2b">offering a glimpse into the inner workings of Trump’s real estate empire</a>. Weisselberg has worked for Trump’s family for nearly 50 years, starting as an accountant for his developer father, Fred Trump, in 1973. He joined Donald Trump in 1986 and helped expand the company into a global golf and hotel brand.</p><p>Weisselberg told jurors he betrayed the Trump family’s trust by conspiring with a subordinate to hide more than a decade’s worth of extras from his income, including a free Manhattan apartment, luxury cars and his grandchildren’s private school tuition. He said they fudged payroll records and issued falsified W-2 forms.</p><p>A Manhattan jury <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-new-york-manhattan-donald-trump-government-and-politics-86177401a887c85ab50d8b78eb1ed397">convicted the Trump Organization in December</a>, finding that Weisselberg had been a “high managerial” agent entrusted to act on behalf of the company and its various entities. Weisselberg’s arrangement reduced his own personal income taxes but also saved the company money because it didn’t have to pay him more to cover the cost of the perks.</p><p>Prosecutors said other Trump Organization executives also accepted off-the-books compensation. Weisselberg alone was accused of defrauding the federal government, state and city out of more than $900,000 in unpaid taxes and undeserved tax refunds.</p><p>The Trump Organization is scheduled to be sentenced on Friday and faces a fine of up to $1.6 million.</p><p>Weisselberg testified that neither Trump nor his family knew about the scheme as it was happening, choking up as he told jurors: “It was my own personal greed that led to this."</p><p>But prosecutors, in their closing argument, said Trump “knew exactly what was going on” and that evidence, such as a lease he signed for Weisselberg’s apartment, made clear that Trump was "explicitly sanctioning tax fraud.”</p><p>Trump Organization lawyers have said Weisselberg concocted the scheme without Trump or the Trump family’s knowledge.</p><p>Weisselberg said the Trumps remained loyal to him even as the company scrambled to end some of its dubious pay practices following Trump’s 2016 election. He said Trump’s eldest sons, entrusted to run the company while Trump was president, gave him a $200,000 raise after an internal audit found he had been reducing his salary and bonuses by the cost of the perks.</p><p>The company punished him only nominally after his arrest in July 2021, reassigning him to senior adviser and moving his office. He even celebrated his 75th birthday at Trump Tower with cake and colleagues in August, just hours after finalizing the plea agreement that ushered his transformation from loyal executive to prosecution witness and, now, jail inmate.</p><p>Rikers Island, a compound of 10 jails on a spit of land in the East River, just off the main runway at LaGuardia Airport in Queens, has been plagued in recent years by violence, inmate deaths and staggering staffing shortages.</p><p>Though just 5 miles (8 kilometers) from Trump Tower, it’s a veritable world away from the life of luxury Weisselberg schemed to build — a far cry from the gilded Fifth Avenue offices where he hatched his plot and the Hudson River-view apartment he reaped as a reward.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Michael Sisak on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/mikesisak">twitter.com/mikesisak</a> and send confidential tips by visiting <a href="https://www.ap.org/tips/">https://www.ap.org/tips/</a></p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Samantha Sorsby-Jones watched friends at her Texas high school go to great lengths to get birth control: Secretly arranging rides to clinics that didn’t require parental consent and hiding phones in bushes in case parents were tracking them.</p><p>Starting Tuesday, access to reproductive health care is likely to command fresh scrutiny before the Republican-controlled Texas Capitol, where new restrictions are on the table in the first session since a stringent statewide abortion ban took effect.</p><p>Texas' abortion ban is one of the nation's strictest, allowing no exceptions in cases of rape or incest, and Republican leaders have been noncommittal about adding carveouts over the next five months. Nationwide, reproductive rights is poised to remain a dominant issue in other U.S. statehouses, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-health-minnesota-government-and-politics-dfd82ea258e2f8544bb09cea83cabf07">where a patchwork of policies has spread</a> nationwide following the fall of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-decision-854f60302f21c2c35129e58cf8d8a7b0#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20(AP)%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Supreme,Wade.">Roe v. Wade.</a></p><p>“The right to bodily autonomy is being taken away in so many different ways, it is really devastating,” said Sorsby-Jones, 20, who as a high school student three years ago was able to get birth control at a federally funded clinic in Texas after her parents refused to help her.</p><p>But a December ruling by a federal judge in Amarillo has suddenly closed that avenue to other Texas teens. U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk ruled that allowing minors to obtain free birth control without parental consent at federally funded clinics, under a program known as Title X, violated parental rights and state law.</p><div id="afs:Card:959349253064" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="7ba70ebde39cb2d992eeb7e5f32603ca">Hub peek embed (Abortion) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Such clinics offer an array of family planning services and served more than 182,000 people in 2020 in Texas, according to Every Body Texas, which administers the funds for the state. A bill filed by a Democrat in response to Kacsmaryk's ruling could face resistance from Republicans, who have controlled the Texas Legislature for two decades and padded their majority in the fall midterms.</p><p>For Republicans, new proposals include penalizing companies that help their Texas employees seek abortions elsewhere, limiting access to abortion-inducing drugs by mail and dispensing emergency contraception. Anti-abortion groups are also pushing lawmakers in the wake of Texas' abortion ban to spend more money on services for pregnant and parenting Texans, including expanding Medicaid coverage for mothers.</p><p>As Texas lawmakers returned to the Capitol, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and other GOP leaders did not mention further restrictions in ceremonial speeches on the opening day of session, where the Uvalde massacre and how to spend a more than $30 billion budget surplus are also poised to be major issues.</p><p>John Seago, president of the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life, said he doesn't see enough GOP support to create exceptions in the state’s abortion ban. “If we don’t respond to it this session, it kind of becomes the status quo,” Seago said.</p><p>After getting help from a Title X clinic, Sorsby-Jones said she spent years helping other teens find the resources to make independent reproductive health care decisions. In high school, she said, some of her peers had to hide their phones in bushes at a nearby fast food restaurant or leave them at school because of parental geolocation apps.</p><p>When she volunteered with a nonprofit that helps teens access reproductive health resources, Sorsby-Jones said clients included minors in abusive households and those who faced cultural barriers in seeking parental permission for birth control. Though the main focus was contraceptive care, Sorsby-Jones said for many teens, it had to do with accessing medication without stigma for conditions such as endometriosis, which caused them to miss school due to severe abdominal pain.</p><p>Rosann Mariappuram, executive director of Jane’s Due Process, said their organization’s hotline immediately began getting calls and texts with questions from Texas teens after the court decision in December. “When this ruling came down, it basically cut off reproductive rights for teenagers in Texas overnight really,” Mariappuram said.</p><p>At least 13 states have also banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with various exceptions, with many set to discuss ways to limit or expand access as legislatures go back into session across the country. Several existing bans, plus others that are less restrictive, are being challenged in court.</p><p>State Rep. Ana-Maria Ramos, a Democrat from Dallas, filed the proposal that would combat the Title X ruling. She was a recipient of Title X contraceptive care herself after having a child as a teenager.</p><p>“What this bill does is empower teens to make decisions for their own healthcare, but also for their future,” Ramos said.</p><p>_____</p><p>Follow AP's full coverage of abortion: <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/abortion">https://apnews.com/hub/abortion</a></p><p>_____</p><p>Follow Acacia Coronado on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/acacia_coronado">https://twitter.com/acacia_coronado</a></p><p>_____</p><p>This story has been corrected to show state Rep.

(Jan. 10) (AP video/Mario Lobao and Eduardo François)</p>    <p>RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — “No amnesty! No amnesty! No amnesty!”</p><p>The chant reverberated off the walls of the jam-packed hall at the University of Sao Paulo’s law college on Monday afternoon. Within hours, it was the rallying cry for thousands of Brazilians who streamed into the streets of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, penned on protest posters and banners.</p><p>The words are a demand for retribution against the supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro who stormed Brazil’s capital Sunday, and those who enabled the rampage.</p><p>“These people need to be punished, the people who ordered it need to be punished, those who gave money for it need to be punished,” Bety Amin, a 61-year-old therapist, said on Sao Paulo’s main boulevard. The word “DEMOCRACY” stretched across the back of her shirt. “They don’t represent Brazil. We represent Brazil.”</p><div id="afs:Card:272901778982" content-id="b62784248fee194c650df5c1da0fd120" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (JairBolsonaro) - Compressed layout </div><p>Protesters' push for accountability evokes memories of an <a href="https://apnews.com/article/f43a4affb17a41ad992a722b85c5b509">amnesty law</a> that for decades has protected military members accused of abuse and murder during the country's 1964-85 dictatorship. A 2014 truth commission report sparked debate over how Brazil has grappled with the regime's legacy.</p><p>Declining to mete out punishment “can avoid tensions at the moment, but perpetuates instability,” Luis Felipe Miguel, a professor of political science at the University of Brasilia, wrote in a column entitled “No Amnesty” published Monday evening. “That is the lesson we should have learned from the end of the military dictatorship, when Brazil opted not to punish the regime’s killers and torturers.”</p><p>Brazilian police on Monday had already rounded up roughly 1,500 rioters. Some were caught in the act of trashing Brazil's Congress, the Supreme Court and the presidential palace. Most were detained the following morning at an encampment in Brasilia. Many were held in a gymnasium throughout the day, and video shared on pro-Bolsonaro social media channels showed some complaining about poor treatment in the crowded space. </p><p>Almost 600 who were elderly, sick, homeless or mothers with their children were released Tuesday after being questioned and having their phones inspected, the Federal Police said in a statement. Its press office previously told The Associated Press that the force plans to indict at least 1,000 people. As of Tuesday afternoon, 527 people had been transfered to either a detention center or prison.</p><p>The administration of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva says jailing the rioters is only the start.</p><p>Justice minister Flávio Dino vowed to prosecute those who acted behind the scenes to summon supporters on social media and finance their transport on charges involving organized crime, staging a coup, and violent abolition of the democratic rule of law. Authorities also are investigating allegations that local security personnel allowed the destruction to proceed unabated.</p><p>“We cannot and will not compromise in fulfilling our legal duties," Dino said. "This fulfillment is essential so such events do not repeat themselves.” </p><p>Lula signed a decree, now approved by both houses of Congress, ordering the federal government to assume control of security in the capital.</p><p>Far-right elements have refused to accept Bolsonaro’s electoral defeat. Since his Oct. 30 loss, they have camped outside military barracks in Brasilia, pleading for intervention to allow Bolsonaro to remain in power and oust Lula. When no coup materialized, they rose up themselves.</p><p>Decked out in the green and yellow of the national flag, they broke windows, toppled furniture and hurled computers and printers to the ground. They punched holes in a massive Emiliano Di Cavalcanti painting at the presidential palace and destroyed other works of art. They overturned the U-shaped table where Supreme Court justices convene, ripped a door off one justice’s office and vandalized a statue outside the court. Hours passed before police expelled the mob.</p><p>"It's unacceptable what happened yesterday. It's terrorism," Marcelo Menezes, a 59-year-old police officer from northeastern Pernambuco state, said at a protest in Sao Paulo. “I’m here in defense of democracy, I’m here in defense of the people.”</p><p>Cries of “No amnesty!" were also heard during Lula's Jan. 1 inaugural address, in response to the president <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-politics-brazil-brasilia-inaugurations-c6d222207d7a5bcbb71e2b6950514a9a">detailing the neglect</a> of the outgoing Bolsonaro administration. </p><p>Bolsonaro, a former army captain, has waxed nostalgic for the dictatorship era, praised a notorious torturer as a hero and said the regime should have gone further in executing communists. His government also <a href="https://apnews.com/article/df51ee5d7cf94516a537a077e0b2721c">commemorated the anniversary</a> of Brazil’s 1964 coup.</p><p>Political analysts had repeatedly warned that Bolsonaro was laying the groundwork for an insurrection in the mold of that which <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-steve-bannon-politics-brazil-government-22a083f0d08bb9d1d93b67871a103b0c">unfolded in the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6</a>, 2021. For months, he stoked belief among hardcore supporters that the nation’s electronic voting system was prone to fraud — though he never presented any evidence and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-caribbean-voting-donald-trump-elections-fb592d5165e5bb07c0426199d86b5787">independent experts disagreed.</a></p><p>Results from the election, the closest since Brazil's return to democracy, were quickly recognized by politicians across the spectrum, including some Bolsonaro allies, as well as dozens of other governments. The outgoing president surprised nearly everyone by promptly <a href="about:blank">fading from view</a>, neither conceding defeat nor emphatically crying fraud. He and his party submitted a request to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-caribbean-brazil-c03ec4f0e1d65fc81c02a2d90181cf48">nullify millions of votes</a>, which was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-caribbean-brazil-b7c872b541371ff2925fae793007af87">swiftly dismissed</a> by the electoral authority. </p><p>None of that dissuaded his die-hard backers from their conviction that Bolsonaro should still be in power.</p><p>In the immediate aftermath of the riot, Lula said that the so-called “fascist fanatics” and their financial backers must be held responsible. He also accused Bolsonaro of encouraging the uprising.</p><p>Bolsonaro denied the president’s accusation Sunday. Writing on Twitter, he said peaceful protest is part of democracy, but vandalism and invasion of public buildings cross the line.</p><p>Authorities are also investigating the role of the federal district's police in either failing to halt protesters' advance or standing aside to let them run amok. Prosecutors in the capital said local security forces were negligent at the very least. A supreme court justice temporarily suspended the regional governor, who oversees the force, for what he termed "willful omission". Another justice blamed authorities across Brazil for not swiftly cracking down on “homegrown neofascism.”</p><p>The upheaval finally prompted municipal and state governments to disperse the pro-Bolsonaro encampments outside the military barracks. Their tents and tarps were taken down, and residents were sent packing.</p><p>Meanwhile, pro-democracy protesters want to ensure their message — “No amnesty!” — will be heeded by both the law enforcement authorities and any far-right elements who might dare defy democracy again.</p><p>“After what happened yesterday, we need to go to the street,” said Marcos Gama, a retiree protesting Monday night in Sao Paulo. “We need to react.”</p><p>___</p><p>AP videojournalist Mello reported from Sao Paulo.

(AP Photo/Lee Jin-man, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>BEIJING (AP) — Chinese embassies suspended issuing new visas for South Koreans and Japanese on Tuesday in apparent retaliation for COVID-19 testing requirements recently imposed by those countries on travelers from China.</p><p>The embassies in Tokyo and Seoul announced the suspensions in brief online notices. </p><p>The Seoul notice, posted on the embassy's WeChat social media account, said the ban would continue until South Korea lifts its “discriminatory entry measures” against China. The announcement covered tourist, business and some other visas.</p><p>China's Foreign Ministry <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-sports-health-china-beijing-d9b5f0e1520c899ffe6b614135be73a8">threatened countermeasures</a> last week against countries that had announced new virus testing requirements for travelers from China. At least 10 in Europe, North America and Asia have done so recently, with officials expressing concern about a lack of information about rapidly spreading virus outbreaks in China.</p><p>It wasn’t clear why South Korea and Japan were targeted, and whether the suspensions would be expanded to other countries that have imposed virus testing on passengers from China. </p><p>China's embassy in Tokyo said only that visa issuance had been suspended. The announcements appeared to apply only to new applicants, with nothing about people currently holding visas.</p><p>South Korea’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that “our government’s step to strengthen anti-virus measures on passengers arriving from China is based on scientific and objective evidence. We have provided information to the international community in a transparent manner and we have communicated with the Chinese side in advance.”</p><p>A Japanese Foreign Ministry official said earlier that it would be “regrettable” if restrictions were imposed. The official spoke on customary condition of anonymity.</p><p>A withholding of visas from South Korean or Japanese businesspeople could delay a hoped-for revival of commercial activity and potential new investment following China’s abrupt lifting of anti-virus controls last month.</p><p>Business groups had warned earlier that global companies were shifting investment plans away from China because it was too hard for foreign executives to visit under the pandemic controls. A handful of foreign auto and other executives have visited China over the past three years, but many companies have relied on Chinese employees or managers already in the country to run their operations.</p><p>A South Korean restaurant owner in Beijing said the announcement forced friends to postpone plans to visit China. He spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern his business might be affected. He added that he is preparing to renew his Chinese work visa and doesn’t know whether that will be affected.</p><p>In a phone call on Monday before the visa suspension was announced, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang “expressed concern” about the measures taken by South Korea to his counterpart, Foreign Minister Park Jin. Qin said he “hopes that the South Korean side will uphold an objective and scientific attitude."</p><p>China's move appeared to be grounded in its demands that its citizens be treated the same as those of other countries. About a dozen countries have followed the U.S. in requiring either a negative test before departing China, a virus test on arrival at the airport, or both.</p><p>“Regrettably, a handful of countries, in disregard of science and facts and the reality at home, have insisted on taking discriminatory entry restriction measures targeting China," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Tuesday. "China firmly rejected this and took reciprocal measures."</p><p>He did not respond directly when asked if new visas had been suspended for South Koreans and Japanese, saying only that he had “made it very clear."</p><p>The World Health Organization and several nations have accused China of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-covid19-data-sharing-77a28c2fc02f4c01774db8836762b608">withholding data</a> on its outbreak. A WHO official said Tuesday that t <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-covid-19-pandemic-china-europe-world-organization-2cead41e96c46b8027c26510bddb0873">he agency sees no immediate threat</a> for the European region from China's outbreak, but that more information is needed.</p><p>China’s ambassador to Australia said the response of those nations to China’s COVID-19 outbreak hadn’t been proportionate or constructive. </p><p>Xiao Qian told reporters in Canberra that China had shifted its strategy late last year from preventing infections to preventing severe cases. He said countries should use a science-based response.</p><p>“Entry restrictions, if they’re targeted at China, they’re unnecessary,” the ambassador told reporters.</p><p>Once-cordial ties between South Korea and China, its biggest trading partner, soured after Beijing targeted businesses, sports teams and even K-pop groups to protest deployment of an advanced U.S. anti-missile system in South Korea. </p><p>China fought on the side of North Korea in the 1950-1953 war and has remained a supporter of the North despite its missile launches and nuclear tests, and has opposed further sanctions against Kim Jong Un's government. </p><p>China abruptly reversed its strict pandemic containment requirements last month in response to what it says was the changing nature of the outbreak. That came after three years of lockdowns, quarantines and mass testing that prompted rare politically tinged protests in the streets in Beijing and other major cities. </p><p>The most optimistic forecasts say <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-health-china-government-hospitality-and-leisure-industry-337dd313fdc7037c34caf55dc2c80acd">China’s business</a> and consumer activity might revive as early as the first quarter of this year. But before that happens, entrepreneurs and families face a painful squeeze from a surge in virus cases that has left employers without enough healthy workers and kept wary customers away from shopping malls, restaurants, hair salons and gyms.</p><p>The decision by Xi's government to end controls that shut down factories and kept millions of people at home will move up the timeline for economic recovery but might disrupt activity this year as businesses scramble to adapt, forecasters say. </p><p>China is now facing a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-health-china-government-philippines-89822deed22950db4e9b6c5e9c675414">surge in cases and hospitalizations</a> in major cities and is bracing for a further spread into less developed areas with the start of the Lunar New Year travel rush, set to accelerate in the coming days. While international flights are still reduced, authorities say they expect domestic rail and air journeys will double over the same period last year.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Joe McDonald in Beijing and Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report. </p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Amr Nabil, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Islam's annual hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia will return to pre-pandemic levels this year after restrictions saw the annual religious commemoration curtailed over concerns about the coronavirus, authorities say. </p><p>The hajj, required of all able-bodied Muslims once in their life, represents one of the world's largest gatherings of people. Before the pandemic, the pilgrimage drew millions each year to Islam's holy city of Mecca, home to the cube-shaped Kaaba that observant Muslims pray toward five times a day. </p><p>In 2019, over 2.4 million people took part in the pilgrimage. But in 2020, amid the lockdowns sparked by the pandemic, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-health-ap-top-news-islam-saudi-arabia-56afb6647ea3ae705ce322f8a5ddd4c8">Saudi Arabia drastically curtailed the hajj</a> with as as few as 1,000 residents of Saudi Arabia permitted to take part. It was an unprecedented move unseen even <a href="https://apnews.com/article/asia-pacific-flu-middle-east-ramadan-europe-99cd4d90efcfe62e0518dde701a0608d">during the 1918 flu epidemic that killed tens of millions worldwide.</a></p><p>In 2021, some 60,000 residents of Saudi Arabia attended. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-hajj-pilgrimage-b07c0d27f38f7d58dcce578ff43a6420">Last year saw 1 million faithful perform the pilgrimage</a>. </p><p>Speaking on Monday night at a conference about the hajj in the Red Sea port city of Jeddah, Saudi Hajj and Umrah Minister Tawfiq bin Fawzan al-Rabiah announced the lifting of the restrictions. </p><div id="afs:Card:495867131537" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="ffd5a032b33d2814f333e5a960d74c1d">Hub peek embed (apf-religion) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“I bring you two bits of good news in this meeting. The first: The return of the numbers of pilgrims to what they were before the pandemic without any age restrictions," al-Rabiah said, according to the state-run Saudi Press Agency. </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“And the second: Allowing any hajj mission from around the world to deal with any licensed company that meets the requirements of the pilgrims of those countries,” he added. </p><p>Only those between the ages of 18 to 65 could attend the hajj in recent years. Saudi Arabia also had limited which private companies could conduct travel arrangements for the hajj. </p><p>The coronavirus isn't the first public health disaster to strike the hajj. The kingdom’s Al Saud ruling family stakes its legitimacy in this oil-rich nation on overseeing and protecting the hajj sites. Ensuring the hajj happens has been a priority for them — and also a main economic driver bringing billions of dollars of non-oil revenue to Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Disease outbreaks have always been a concern surrounding the hajj. Pilgrims fought off a malaria outbreak in 632, cholera in 1821 killed an estimated 20,000, and another cholera outbreak in 1865 killed 15,000 before spreading worldwide.</p><p>More recently, Saudi Arabia faced danger from a different coronavirus, one that causes the Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS. The kingdom increased its public health measures during the hajj in 2012 and 2013, urging the sick and the elderly not to take part.</p><p>In recent years, Saudi officials also instituted bans on pilgrims coming from countries affected by the Ebola virus.</p><p>It wasn't immediately clear what health precautions would be taken for the hajj, which falls according to the lunar-based Islamic calendar this year at the end of June. While Saudi Arabia has no requirement for coronavirus vaccines or testing, it does require pilgrims to be vaccinated for other maladies. </p><p>Muslims have been prohibited from kissing or touching the cube-shaped Kaaba, the metaphorical house of God at the center of Mecca that pilgrims circle as they complete the hajj.</p><p>The hajj also involves close contact in large crowds, which <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mecca-dubai-united-arab-emirates-archive-saudi-arabia-3a42a7733a8b476889bb4b7b3be3560e">in 2015 saw over 2,400 people killed in a crush and stampede</a>. </p><p>___</p><p>Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellAP. </p>]]></description>

(Jan. 6)</p>    <p>After going dark for a year, the <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/golden-globe-awards">Golden Globes</a> return to the air Tuesday on a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/golden-globe-awards-hollywood-foreign-press-association-tv-television-9ee1a25e378b0c707dcd1f5f205c405b">one-year audition to try to win back their awards-season perch</a> and relevancy to a Hollywood that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-boycotts-golden-globe-awards-d8d0bc76fc84832aa29842261af7687e">shunned the awards</a> after an ethics and diversity scandal.</p><p>Stars and studios boycotted <a href="https://apnews.com/article/golden-globe-awards-7807652153518b2df70e636dd22654c2">last year's ceremony</a>, which <a href="https://apnews.com/article/golden-globe-awards-entertainment-arts-and-entertainment-1ac9492d657cf39427c886bf65ed37b1">NBC opted not to televise</a>, saying the Hollywood Foreign Press Association needed time to make “meaningful reform.” A year later, much — though not all — of Hollywood appears ready to party, again.</p><p>Following red carpet coverage (E! will air it live beginning at 6 p.m. EST), the broadcast from the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, starts at 8 p.m. on NBC. For the first time, the show will also be livestreamed, on NBCUniversal's Peacock. When the Globes were on the brink, NBC reworked its deal with the HFPA, putting the awards on a one-year contract and moving the show to Tuesday from its regular Sunday night spot.</p><p>The Globes will <a href="https://apnews.com/article/floods-weather-natural-disasters-landslides-and-mudslides-storms-21b103e791710f4af6ca0ce45c6030b5">unfold against the backdrop of heavy rains</a> that have lashed Southern California and caused flooding up and down coastal areas and in the mountains outside Los Angeles. Prolonged rainfall, exceeding a foot since Sunday in some regions, caused flooding, mudslides and evacuations. More precipitation was forecast for Tuesday. </p><p>Hosting is comedian Jerrod Carmichael, who won an Emmy last year for his HBO special “Rothaniel." Eddie Murphy and Ryan Murphy are set to receive tributes. Presenters include Ana de Armas (a nominee for “Blonde”), Jenna Ortega (nominated for “Wednesday”), Billy Porter, Tracy Morgan, Jennifer Coolidge (nominated for “White Lotus”) and Quentin Tarantino. Sean Penn will also introduce a message from Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. </p><div id="1f7697d0-7820-11ed-f094-3bb60d58651d" class="related-story-embed"></div><p>UNTANGLING THE GLOBES' MESS</p><p>The Globes were plunged into chaos shortly before <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nomadland-borat-winners-golden-globes-c1a33414af2358ff72f3ceda7f02125e">a largely remote pandemic 2021 awards show</a> when <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-02-21/hfpa-golden-globes-2021-who-are-the-members">a Los Angeles Times report</a> revealed that the HFPA, then numbering 87 members, had no Black members. A separate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/23/movies/the-golden-globes-lawsuit-hollywood-foreign-press.html?searchResultPosition=22">New York Times report</a> showed that the group — an often ridiculed collection of little-known foreign journalists based in Los Angeles — paid its members some $3 million in annual salaries, and detailed a litany of ethical lapses in how the organization regularly interacted with potential nominees.</p><p>Under mounting pressure, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-arts-and-entertainment-golden-globe-awards-65f15226ed39d816f5de20c0fa358d38">HFPA pledged to reform</a>, diversified its membership and changed some of the ways it operates. It now has 96 members, including six Black members, along with 103 nonmember voters. Billionaire Todd Boehly purchased the Globes through his Eldridge Industries, and has begun turning the nonprofit group into a for-profit company.</p><p>IS ANYONE STILL BOYCOTTING?</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/golden-globe-nominations-2023-movies-television-hfpa-9d39f89d293e59ac5bda2d55cf21a9d6">Reaction to the Globe nominations last month was muted</a>, with few stars publicly celebrating. But only one nominee has stated emphatically that he will not attend: Brendan Fraser. Though nominated for best actor for his performance in “The Whale,” Fraser <a href="https://apnews.com/article/brendan-fraser-will-not-attend-2023-golden-globes-d09df6c03e4094acf835ec65d2e8bbaa">said he would not participate in the Globes.</a> In 2018, Fraser said he was groped in 2003 by longtime Hollywood Foreign Press Association member Philip Berk. Berk, who is no longer an HFPA member, denied it.</p><div id="96d6dcc4556544d2bdd65950349e0f29" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Eyes will be especially trained Tuesday on Tom Cruise, whose “Top Gun: Maverick” is nominated for best picture, drama. Cruise responded more forcefully to the HFPA revelations than almost anyone in the industry, returning his three Golden Globe awards. </p><p>But all studios are again participating in the Globes. </p><p>As it has for most award shows, viewership to the Globes telecast has cratered. After the 2020 awards were watched by 18.4 million, the 2021 edition managed just 6.9 million, according to Nielsen. Still, the Globes remain a valuable marketing tool for awards contenders, propping up ads for films in the long stretch between the holidays and the Oscars, which air March 12. Some of this season's top contenders, including Steven Spielberg's “The Fabelmans" and Todd Fields' “Tár," have struggled to attract large audiences.</p><p>THE NOMINEES</p><p>Martin McDonagh’s feuding friends tale “The Banshees of Inisherin” comes in with a leading eight nominations, including nods for actors Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan. Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert’s existential action comedy “Everything Everywhere all at Once” is up for six awards, including nods for Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis.</p><p>Several of the past year's biggest box-office hits are also in the mix. Along with “Top Gun: Maverick," “Tár” and “The Fabelmans,” the nominees for best picture, drama, include <a href="https://apnews.com/article/avatar-james-cameron-way-of-water-sequel-interview-movies-ceb3a4b7338bc54c013ce24d0f1d6765">James Cameron's “Avatar: The Way of Water”</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/elvis-movie-review-b18e59c1b13c603e0fdd55adcea53f4d">Baz Luhrmann's “Elvis.”</a></p><p>On the TV side, the public school sitcom “Abbott Elementary” leads with five nominations, including a nod for Quinta Brunson's lead performance. “The White Lotus,” “Dahmer,” “The Crown,” “Pam &amp; Tommy” and “Only Murders in the Building” all scored four nominations each. </p><p>Other nominees include: Brad Pitt (“Babylon”), Viola Davis (“The Woman King”), Daniel Craig (“Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery”), Angela Bassett (“Black Panther: Wakanda Forever”), Julia Roberts (“Gaslit”), Donald Glover (“Atlanta”), Bill Hader (“Barry”), Selena Gomez (“Only Murders in the Building”), Kevin Costner (“Yellowstone"), Diego Luna (“Andor”) and Bob Odenkirk (“Better Call Saul”).</p><p>___</p><p>For more coverage of Hollywood's awards season, visit https://apnews.com/hub/awards-season</p><div id="afs:Card:347497716740" content-id="38f7af2fc28d44729beed3c4a1527ca0" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (AwardsSeason) - Compressed layout </div>]]></description>

But his gym in the eastern city of Shenyang has been closed for a month because all its coaches are infected.</p><p>The most optimistic forecasts say China's business and consumer activity might revive as early as the first quarter of this year. But before that happens, entrepreneurs and families face a painful squeeze from a surge in virus cases that has left employers without enough healthy workers and kept wary customers away from shopping malls, restaurants, hair salons and gyms.</p><p>“I hope the situation will turn around in March or April with no more COVID shocks,” said Wang, 33, who went without a paycheck for four months when the gym closed during virus outbreaks. “If parents worry about possible reinfection, they simply won’t send their children for training.”</p><p>The abrupt decision by President Xi Jinping's government to end controls that shut down factories and kept millions of people at home will move up the timeline for economic recovery, but might disrupt activity this year as businesses scramble to adapt, forecasters say.</p><p>“This will be a bumpy process,” said Dong Chen, chief Asia economist for Pictet Wealth Management.</p><div id="afs:Card:386669778972" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="337dd313fdc7037c34caf55dc2c80acd">Hub peek embed (Inflation) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“People still are <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-china-covid-0437741cbb7db5e090bcf904ff38779b">struggling with infections</a>, but we think this could be temporary,” Chen said. “Broadly, we think this is a positive surprise.”</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The decision to accelerate China's reopening is a boost for the global economy at a time when activity in the United States and Europe is weakening after <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-europe-business-european-central-bank-14fb0276e8dc68d295043cc1a0d7091e">repeated interest rate hikes</a> by central banks to cool surging inflation.</p><p>It is likely to help revive auto sales and propel demand for imported consumer goods, oil and food in China, one of the biggest global markets. Countries including <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-china-thailand-travel-and-tourism-business-5568e441ab99c808d459c4cccb090856">Thailand with big tourism industries</a> look forward to an influx of Chinese travelers.</p><p>The World Bank and private sector forecasters have cut estimates of China's economic growth last year to as low as 2.2% due to the infection spike that started in early October and challenged Beijing's “zero-COVID” goal of isolating every case. The International Monetary Fund expects a recovery to 4.4% this year, but that still would be among the lowest levels of the past three decades.</p><p>“Zero-COVID” kept China’s infection numbers low but shut down Shanghai and other industrial cities last year for two months, disrupting manufacturing and shipping. Business groups said global companies were shifting investment plans away from China because rules that required visitors from abroad to quarantine for a week kept executives from visiting.</p><p>The ruling party promised Nov. 11 to reduce the cost and disruption. A series of surprise announcements rolled back travel and other restrictions that health experts and economists had expected to persist through mid-2023.</p><p>On Sunday, Beijing began <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-china-hong-kong-beijing-business-49e31dedb78fd24c1077b340ebdafa1f">allowing travelers to enter China without quarantines</a>. The government has yet to say when China will resume issuing tourist visas.</p><p>“The sudden, chaotic way in which pandemic policies have been changed means that growth will be hampered in new ways,” Daniel H. Rosen, Charlie Vest and Rogan Quinn of Rhodium Group said in a report. High numbers of infections make it "realistic to expect production to be hampered for a substantial part of 2023.”</p><p>Forecasters say the economy probably contracted in the final quarter of 2022 as virus case numbers rose and retail spending and trade fell. </p><p>Exports shrank after American and European consumer demand was depressed by interest rate hikes. That forces Chinese planners to make up for lost foreign sales by trying to boost consumer demand.</p><p>“The key to rapid economic recovery" is to "convert income into consumption and investment as much as possible,” one of the country's most prominent financial figures, Guo Shuqing, the ruling party secretary for the central bank, told the official Xinhua News Agency. </p><p>Informal measures show public and business activity improving but weak.</p><p>This month’s subway passenger numbers in 10 large cities recovered to 55-60% of the level a year ago, up from 30-35% last month, according to Macquarie Group. Roads are growing more congested. </p><p>Foreign companies that see China as a critical market welcome the change but are struggling, said Eric Zheng, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.</p><p>“Companies were not prepared for this abrupt change,” said Zheng, whose group has about 1,000 member companies. “It is hard to manage a workforce when a lot of people are getting sick.”</p><p>Still, “things are almost going back to normal,” Zheng said. “Once life goes back to normal and consumers are out shopping, things will definitely improve.”</p><p>Another business group, the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said more than 70% of companies that responded to a poll last month expressed confidence the infection wave would last no more than three months and end early this year.</p><p>The ruling party is trying to nudge up growth by easing restrictions on financing for real estate and winding down anti-monopoly and data security crackdowns on tech companies that caused their stock market values to plunge.</p><p>In December, regulators announced Ant Group, an online financial company that was forced to call off a planned multibillion-dollar public stock offering in 2020, would be allowed to raise 10.5 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) for its consumer unit, more than doubling its capital.</p><p>“These measures are helpful, but far from enough to move the needle,” Larry Hu and Yuxiao Zhang of Macquarie said in a report.</p><p>Hotels, restaurants and other businesses hoping for a boost from this month’s Lunar New Year holiday, the busiest tourism season, suffered a blow when some local authorities appealed to migrant workers to skip traditional visits to their hometowns that might spread infections.</p><p>The operator of the 12-room Oriental Hotel in the eastern city of Hefei, who would give only his family name, Huang, said he is losing 4,000 yuan ($550) a month. His occupancy rate is 20%, well below the 50% needed to break even.</p><p>“People stay home and maybe they worry about possible reinfection,” Huang said. “If it stays the same for another year, I will give up running the hotel.”</p><p>The National Health Commission stopped announcing case numbers last month, but reports by city and county governments suggest hundreds of millions of people might have been infected.</p><p>The Zhengtai Restaurant in the northwestern city of Jinzhong closed for two weeks because almost all its 57 employees were infected, according to the manager, Chang Zhigang. Chang said the business has lost about 2 million yuan ($300,000) per year since the start of the pandemic.</p><p>“We don’t expect the situation to turn around within a short time, given there are very few people on the street,” Chang said.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press researcher Yu Bing contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

(AP) — When Jamieson Brill answers a crisis call from a Spanish speaker on the newly launched national 988 mental health helpline, he rarely mentions the word suicide, or “suicidio”</p><p>Brill, whose family hails from Puerto Rico, knows that just discussing the term in some Spanish-speaking cultures is so frowned upon that many callers are too scared to even admit that they’re calling for themselves.</p><p>“However strong stigma around mental health concerns is in English-speaking cultures, in Spanish-speaking cultures it is triple that,” said Brill, who helps people navigate mental health crises from a tiny brick building tucked away in Hyattsville, Maryland. </p><p>Brill works in one of more than 200 call centers fanned out around the country tasked with answering an uptick in calls day and night from people considering suicide or experiencing a mental health emergency. </p><p>With <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-lifestyle-health-business-mental-health-90a9d04a8c027a3abbd231d234ed0adf">bipartisan congressional support and just under $1 billion in federal funds</a>, the 988 mental health helpline has quickly expanded its reach in the six months since it launched — with over 2 million calls, texts and chat messages pouring in. </p><p>The number of centers answering calls in Spanish grew from three to seven last year. A pilot line dedicated to LGBTQ youth started taking calls in September. And plans are underway to keep the momentum going, with the federal government adding Spanish language chat and text options later this year and aiming to expand those services to a 24/7 operation for the LGBTQ line.</p><div id="afs:Card:029281580227" content-id="313c20b2098469f04ccadcccdfd46b1b" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (apf-Health) - Compressed layout (automatic embed)</div><p>When the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mental-health-hotline-988-ac50f02b74b8b89be5592be3f3605ff5">around-the-clock service launched last summer</a>, it built on the existing network that staffed the old national lifeline, 1-800-273-8255. The new 988 number is designed to be as easy to remember as 911. </p><p>It couldn’t have come at a more needed time: <a href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-ca-state-wire-health-ny-state-wire-ap-top-news-208872f1d9fa3a3f3b50a4a902132124">Depression rates in U.S. adults</a>, overdose deaths and suicide rates have been on the rise.</p><div class="social-embed" id="se0:49b15110-7820-11ed-927d-19b5c9c1f16f"><iframe title="Mental health line texting on the rise" aria-label="Stacked Column Chart" id="ap-chart-A1hYJ" src="https://interactives.ap.org/embeds/A1hYJ/4/" scrolling="no" width="100%" style="border:none" height="400" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe><p class="social-caption"> </p></div><p>“The call volume is, in some instances, well beyond what we anticipated,” said Miriam Delphin-Rittmon, assistant secretary for mental health and substance use in the Department of Health and Human Services. “It does let us know that people are struggling, people are having a hard time. Where I feel heartened is that people are getting connected to services and supports, as opposed to struggling on their own.” </p><p>The 988 helpline registered 154,585 more calls, texts and chat messages during November 2022 compared to the old national lifeline in November 2021, according to the latest data available. </p><p>Texting has been particularly popular, with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration noting a 1,227% increase in texts to the line during that same time. </p><p>The Veterans Crisis Line — callers can press “1” after texting or calling 988 to reach it — has fielded 450,000 calls, texts and chat messages, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs. By the end of the year, the line had handled a nearly 10% increase compared to 2021.</p><p>Calls show no signs of slowing into this year, with counselors answering 3,869 calls on New Year's Eve and the first day of 2023 — a 30 percent increase compared to the previous holiday. The Spanish language line saw an increase of 3,800 calls year over year from November 2021 to November 2022. </p><p>Meanwhile, some states are considering unveiling their own lines dedicated to certain communities. </p><p>In November, Washington became the first state to launch a mental health crisis line dedicated to American Indian and Alaska Native people. Callers in Washington can reach the line by calling 988 then pressing “4” to be greeted by one of the 13 counselors — all Indigenous people — who staff the phones. </p><p>Having fellow American Indians answer those calls is crucial, because those familiar with the culture can immediately decode some terms that others cannot, said Rochelle Williams, the tribal operations manager for Volunteers of America Western Washington, which oversees the call center. For example, she said, when a caller says that a relative is “bothering me,” that sends up an immediate red flag: The person is likely signaling that they’re the victim of a sexual assault.</p><p>“Who has a better understanding of native people than native people?” Williams said. “We don’t trust in a lot of government programs. Knowing you’re talking to another Indigenous person is really important.” </p><p>Williams wants to add chat and text options next. She hopes Washington’s 988 line for Native Americans becomes a model for others. She’s already given presentations in New Mexico, Oklahoma, Montana and in Canada, which is set to launch its own national 988 this year.</p><p>States are expected to receive more money to fund the line from the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-ukraine-government-us-republican-party-health-care-costs-13f3f7bfed22bda0cbf73002d9fec273">$1.7 trillion end-of-the year spending package</a>, which set aside another half-billion dollars for the project. </p><p>Still, long-term funding for the 988 helpline is in jeopardy in some states, which have yet to figure out a permanent funding plan for it. While the federal government has poured millions of dollars into the project, states are expected to take over the operation and funding of the 988 line — just as they do with 911 emergency call services.</p><p>So far, fewer than 20 states <a href="https://reimaginecrisis.org/map/">have passed legislation to permanently fund their 988 line</a>, according to the National Alliance on Mental Health Illness. </p><p>In Ohio, for example, advocates are pushing for the state legislature to sign off on a 50-cent fee that would be tacked onto cellphone bills, raising roughly $50 million to $55 million every year to operate the line, said Tony Coder of the Ohio Suicide Prevention Foundation. </p><p>“Quite frankly, lives depend on it,” Coder said. “The need for 988 services is more crucial than ever, simply because of the aftermath and the mental health issues from COVID.”</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>MEXICO CITY (AP) — President Joe Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday pledged to promote prosperity for people throughout the hemisphere as they opened wide-ranging talks about the fragile security situation in Haiti, North American trade, political unrest in Brazil and more on the sidelines of the North American Leaders Summit.</p><p>Biden and Trudeau met one-on-one before a three-way meeting with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador at the Mexico City summit. The U.S. and Canadian leaders' warmth during a brief appearance before reporters at the start of their talks stood in stark contrast to a more brusque exchange a day earlier between Biden and López Obrador, who had complained of “abandonment” and “disdain” for Latin America.</p><p>Biden told Trudeau, "What we should be doing, and we are doing, is demonstrating the unlimited economic potential that we have when we work together in the hemisphere, and to help the entire hemisphere.”</p><p>All three world leaders were to discuss migration, trade and climate change as they look to mend <a href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-coronavirus-pandemic-joe-biden-donald-trump-technology-b6e962e92ecc600c4bd2ddc65c327d4d">tensions that have divided the continent</a>. </p><p>The three-way gathering is held most years, although there was a hiatus while Donald Trump was U.S. president. It’s often called the “three amigos summit,” a reference to the deep diplomatic and economic ties among the countries.</p><div id="afs:Card:130243251955" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="d6f622d986bc07fae93fa4c53bfaaef9">Hub peek embed (JoeBiden) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>However, the leaders have found themselves at odds, especially as they struggle to handle <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-immigration-el-paso-d0a9ab87492fd4e9e3061ebefc6e1094">an influx of migrants</a> and to crack down on smugglers who profit from persuading people to make the dangerous trip to the United States.</p><p>In addition, Canada and the U.S. accuse López Obrador of violating a free trade pact by favoring Mexico’s state-owned utility over <a href="https://apnews.com/article/canada-mexico-caribbean-global-trade-7a53fb3f204bdc1e79f08a6ac852c20a">power plants built by foreign and private investors</a>. Meanwhile, Trudeau and López Obrador are concerned about Biden’s efforts to boost domestic manufacturing, creating concerns that U.S. neighbors could be left behind.</p><p>Trudeau emphasized in his meeting with Biden the benefits of free trade and warned against Buy America policies that the U.S. administration has promoted, according to the prime minister's office. Nearly 80% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S., so avoiding protectionism remains a priority for Canada.</p><p>The key takeaways from the summit revolve around better connections among the three nations and a shared goal of a stronger North America on energy and in particular semiconductors, climate and a pledge to cut methane emissions, an agreement to manage large waves of migrants coming to the region and a more cohesive regional strategy on dealing with future pandemic-related health threats. </p><p>The dynamics as the Biden-Trudeau talks opened could not have been more different than for the Biden-López Obrador talks.</p><p>During that meeting, the Mexican leader challenged Biden to improve life across the region, telling him that “you hold the key in your hand.”</p><p>“This is the moment for us to determine to do away with this abandonment, this disdain, and this forgetfulness for Latin America and the Caribbean,” Lopez Obrador said.</p><p>Biden responded by pointing to the billions of dollars that the United States spends in foreign aid around the world.</p><p>At the start of Tuesday's Biden-Trudeau meeting, the leaders spoke familiarly and with optimism. Trudeau called the U.S. president “Joe" and Biden joked with Trudeau — after the Canadian leader had delivered a statement to reporters in English and French — that he should have paid more attention in his college French classes.</p><p>Biden and Trudeau also discussed their countries' efforts to support Ukraine nearly 11 months after Russia's invasion. Canada announced Tuesday that it would buy an American-made National Advanced Surface to Air Missile System, or NASAMS, to be donated to Ukraine. The medium-range ground-based air defense system, which protects against drone, missile and aircraft attacks, costs about $406 million and brings Canada's contribution to Ukraine to more than $1 billion since the start of the war. </p><p>The White House said in a statement that the leaders also discussed “the generational opportunity to strengthen supply chains for critical minerals, electric vehicles, and semiconductors.” The U.S. administration also announced that Biden will make his first visit to Canada as president in March.</p><p>“There’s a lot of reasons to be optimistic, especially for those of us in our countries,” Trudeau said. “But it’s going to take a lot of work, something neither you or I or most our citizens have ever been afraid of.”</p><p>Biden and López Obrador haven’t been on particularly good terms for the past two years. The Mexican leader made no secret of his admiration for Trump, and last year <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-covid-politics-health-6efb4c2bde5d080a9ee400a0981f7a61">he skipped a Los Angeles summit</a> of the Americas because Biden didn’t invite the authoritarian leaders of Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. </p><p>However, there have been attempts at a thaw. Biden made a point of flying into <a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-technology-travel-business-health-c3e5a593e5f99167b94f8b037b7cc60c">the new Felipe Angeles International Airport</a>, a prized project of the Mexican president even though it’s been a source of controversy. </p><p>The airport, which is expected to cost $4.1 billion when finished, is more than an hour’s drive north of the city center, has few flights and until recently lacked consistent drinking water. However, it’s one of the keystone projects that López Obrador is racing to finish before his term ends next year. The U.S. president is scheduled to depart from Mexico City International Airport on Tuesday evening.</p><p>The U.S. and Mexico have also reached an agreement on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-mexico-immigration-af0643a4fb8f45388fe247e44c9b2c5e">a major shift in migration policy</a>, which Biden announced last week. </p><p>Under the plan, the U.S. will send 30,000 migrants per month from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela back across the border from among those who entered the U.S. illegally. Migrants who arrive from those four countries are not easily returned to their home countries for a variety of reasons.</p><p>In addition, 30,000 people per month from those four nations <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-venezuela-mexico-spokane-violence-0eb316a474baed22f433359b0644320b">who get sponsors,</a> background checks and an airline flight to the U.S. will be able to work legally in the country for two years. </p><p>The number of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border has risen dramatically during Biden’s first two years in office. There were more than 2.38 million stops during the year that ended Sept. 30, the first time the number topped 2 million. </p><p>Biden said he and Trudeau would discuss “how we can try to help stabilize Haiti."</p><p>Canada is weighing whether to lead an international mission to Haiti to help solve the ongoing humanitarian and security crisis.</p><p>Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry and the country’s Council of Ministers sent an urgent appeal Oct. 7 calling for “the immediate deployment of a specialized armed force, in sufficient quantity” to stop the crisis caused partly by the “criminal actions of armed gangs.” But more than three months later, no countries have stepped forward.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Mark Stevenson and Maria Verza in Mexico City; Rob Gillies in Toronto; and Aamer Madhani, Chris Megerian and Josh Boak in Washington contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

Georgia won 65-7. (AP Photo/Ashley Landis)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) — Stetson Bennett flashed a wry grin as he walked off the field, stopping to hug coach Kirby Smart as the crowd roared.</p><p>It was all standing ovations and sideline snacks in the fourth quarter of the most lopsided bowl season game in college football history.</p><p>In emphatic and overwhelming fashion, Georgia became the first team to repeat as College Football Playoff national champions and left no doubt the 'Dawgs are the new bullies on the block.</p><p>Bennett threw two touchdown passes and ran for two scores — in the first half — as No. 1 Georgia demolished No. 3 TCU 65-7 on Monday night.</p><p>The Bulldogs (15-0) are the first repeat champs in major college football since Alabama went back-to-back a decade ago. There appears to be a new dynasty emerging from the Southeastern Conference.</p><p>“We wanted our kids to play without fear,” Smart said. “All year I told them, I said, ‘We ain’t getting hunted guys, we’re doing the hunting, and hunting season’s almost over. We’ve only got one more chance to hunt,' and we hunted tonight.”</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/sports-georgia-bulldogs-cfp-national-championship-texas-christian-horned-frogs-max-duggan-ca281505a86902f96180d9f4833f0f7b">TCU (13-2), the first Cinderella team of the playoff era, never had a chance</a> against the Georgia juggernaut. Unlike Michigan in the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/college-football-sports-texas-christian-horned-frogs-cfp-national-championship-michigan-wolverines-25737654e49a1f8180fd52aba4a90a9b">Fiesta Bowl semifinal</a>, the Bulldogs would not succumb to the Hypnotoads' spell.</p><p>Georgia turned in one of the all-time beatdowns in a big game, reminiscent of Nebraska running over Florida by 38 points in the 1996 Fiesta Bowl, USC's 36-point rout of Oklahoma in the 2005 Orange Bowl and Alabama's 28-point BCS blowout over Notre Dame in 2013.</p><p>But this was worse.</p><p>Too much talent. Too well-coached. Two straight titles for the mean machine in red and black, as the song goes.</p><p>No team has ever scored more points in a national championship game, dating to the beginning of the BCS in 1998.</p><p>With 13:25 left in the fourth quarter, Smart called timeout in the middle of an offensive drive so Bennett could exit to a hero’s ovation in the final game of his circuitous college career.</p><div id="afs:Card:400852081424" content-id="78edb8a1cda7a4f57323defcfa20614c" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (Collegefootball) - Compressed layout (automatic embed)</div><p>“That was special,” said <a href="https://apnews.com/article/college-football-sports-georgia-bulldogs-brock-bowers-stetson-bennett-5b5cf20d268cd21ac84ede4f77a9885c">Bennett, who finished 18 for 25 for 304 yards and four touchdown passes</a>. “I’ll remember that for the rest of my life.”</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/CFBPlayoff/status/1612656131280867331">The Bulldogs were munching on chicken wings</a> on the sideline as the game wound down. Then, for the second straight year, the Bulldogs were showered by confetti and presented a championship trophy.</p><p>“I love this team, I love those fans, I love our band. I love everybody,” Bennett said during the presentation ceremony. “Back-to-back, baby. Back-to-back.”</p><p>Smart is now 81-15 in his first seven seasons at Georgia with two national titles. His mentor, Alabama coach Nick Saban, was 79-15 with three titles in his first seven seasons with the Tide.</p><p>The Bulldogs were a different kind of dominant this season after losing 15 NFL draft picks from the 2021 team: not quite as stingy on defense, but more explosive on offense.</p><p>“Last year’s team probably had more talent on it,” Smart said. "But this year’s team was different, like they had this eye of the tiger. They weren’t going to lose.”</p><p>Earlier in Smart’s tenure at his alma mater, Georgia fans worried about whether the former defensive coordinator for Saban would be able to build an offense to match this high-scoring era of college football.</p><p>Under third-year coordinator Todd Monken, the Bulldogs have become prolific, creative and diverse offensively. They picked apart TCU’s 3-3-5 defense from all angles.</p><p>Versatile tight end Brock Bowers had seven catches for 152 yards. Receiver Ladd McConkey caught two TDs. Georgia ran for 254 yards, with seven players gaining at least 10.</p><p>The Bulldogs scored all six times they touched the ball in the first half. Twice Bennett ran it in himself; the former walk-on-turned-two-time national champion was barely touched on the two quarterback keepers.</p><div id="8ca5ffb1849b455e88e7ef8bc7eea9d4" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>He hit a wide-open McConkey for a 34-yard score in the first quarter, a perfectly executed play out of a bunched formation that had TCU’s defensive backs in disarray. Bennett’s 22-yard score to Adonai Mitchell was a higher degree of difficulty, dropped in over a defender who had tight coverage.</p><p>It looked a lot like the Bennett-to-Mitchell touchdown that gave Georgia a fourth-quarter lead it would not relinquish against Alabama in last year’s CFP title game.</p><p>Georgia vanquished the Tide last season to break a 41-year national title drought, avenging its only regular-season loss in the process.</p><p>There was no such drama against the upstart Horned Frogs.</p><p>“The journey was great. It’s something I’ll never forget,” TCU running back Emari Demercado said. “Obviously, didn’t end how we wanted it, but at the end of the day this journey was something great.”</p><p>These Bulldogs never had to worry about Alabama. They rolled through the SEC, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/college-football-sports-ohio-cfp-national-championship-georgia-bulldogs-9ce931f46a7dfca53f04db37a65c5ce0">survived Ohio State in a classic CFP semifinal</a> and then completed a perfect season with a historic blowout.</p><p>“Do you have to take a loss to learn?” Smart said. “I mean, why?”</p><p>Bennett hit Bowers for a 22-yard score with 10:52 left in the third quarter to make it 45-7. The sophomore from Northern California signaled touchdown while lying on the turf at SoFi Stadium. Bennett smiled as he tapped helmets with one of his linemen.</p><p>“He's got GOAT status and in Athens, Georgia forever,” Smart said.</p><p>Georgia’s famous bulldog mascot UGA could not make cross-country trip to root on his team, but it still felt a little like Sanford Stadium in SoCal.</p><p>Many of the TCU fans cleared out with more than half the fourth quarter left, choosing to venture out into a rainy and chilly night rather than watch any more of the massive mismatch.</p><p>“I’m disappointed we didn’t make a better show tonight because that’s not indicative of who we are. But we’ll look back — it’s going to take some time for the sting to go away, I assure you — but we’ll look back on the season and build on it from here,” first-year coach Sonny Dykes said.</p><p>Heisman Trophy runner-up Max Duggan threw two first-half interceptions in the final game of his roller-coaster TCU career. A four-year starter who never played in a bowl before this season, Duggan led TCU on one of the most improbable runs in college football history. </p><p>Unranked after a losing 2021 season and picked seventh in the Big 12, the Frogs won nine games by 10 or fewer points. They were within a victory of the program’s first national title since 1938.</p><p>But they ran into a monster.</p><p>“As long as you don’t have entitlement in your program, you’ve got a shot,” Smart said. “And right now we don’t have that.”</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Ralph D.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-us-republican-party-united-states-house-of-representatives-kevin-mccarthy-b9fcfd11427a695fe2eb49e36988f1a0">House Republicans</a> began their tenure in the majority Monday by passing a bill that would rescind nearly $71 billion that Congress had provided the IRS, fulfilling a campaign promise even though the legislation is unlikely to advance further.</p><p>Democrats had beefed up the IRS over the next decade to help offset the cost of top health and environmental priorities they passed last year and to replenish an agency struggling to provide basic services to taxpayers and ensure fairness in tax compliance.</p><p>The money is on top of what Congress provides the IRS annually through the appropriations process and immediately became a magnet for GOP campaign ads in the fall claiming that the boost would lead to an army of IRS agents harassing hard-working Americans.</p><p>The bill to rescind the money passed the House on a party-line vote of 221-210. The Democratic-controlled Senate has vowed to ignore it.</p><p>Shortly before the vote, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that rescinding the extra IRS funding would increase deficits over the coming decade by more than $114 billion. That created an awkward moment for Republicans, who have been saying that addressing deficits would be one of their top concerns in the majority. It offered an early example of how the GOP's bold promises on the campaign trail could get tangled in the messy reality of governing. </p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="64692090ef20e35a59ba1ea7d21a9eea">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Still, the CBO's projection didn't appear to dampen Republican support. Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., said the extra IRS funding Democrats provided last year was for one purpose.</p><p>“To go after small businesses, hard-working Americans to try to raise money for reckless spending, reckless spending that has caused $31 trillion in debt in this nation," Duncan said.</p><p>Duncan and other GOP lawmakers routinely say the extra funding will be used to hire 87,000 new agents to target Americans, but that's <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-irs-agents-inflation-reduction-act-871970314297">misleading</a>. The number is based on a Treasury Department plan saying that many IRS employees would be hired over the next decade if it got the money. But those employees will not all be hired at the same time, they will not all be auditors and many will be replacing some 50,000 employees who are expected to quit or retire in coming years. </p><p>“This debate about IRS lends itself to be the most dishonest, demagogic rhetoric that I have seen in the Congress at any point in time," said Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md.</p><p>Charles Rettig, the former commissioner of the IRS, said in a final message to the agency in November that the additional money would help in many areas, not just beefing up tax enforcement. He said the investments would make it “even less likely for honest taxpayers to hear from the IRS or receive an audit letter.”</p><p>Additional funding for the agency has been politically controversial since 2013, when the IRS under the Obama administration was found to have used inappropriate criteria to review tea party groups and other organizations applying for tax-exempt status.</p><p>In the ensuing years, the IRS was mostly on the losing end of congressional funding fights, even as a subsequent 2017 report found that both conservative and liberal groups were chosen for scrutiny.</p><p>In April, Rettig told lawmakers the agency’s budget has decreased by more than 15% over the past decade when accounting for inflation and said the number of full-time employees — 79,000 in the last fiscal year — was close to 1974 levels.</p><p>But Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., and other Republicans weren't buying the argument that the funding would be focused on auditing the wealthy.</p><p>“This is meant to nickel-and-dime, audit and harass America's small businesses and families, who they know cannot afford the legal fees to fight this army," Malliotakis said.</p><p>Sen. Ron Wyden, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said a decade of Republican-led budget cuts gutted the IRS.</p><p>“The only way that House Republicans could make it any more obvious that they’re doing a favor for wealthy tax cheats is by coming out and saying it in exactly those words," Wyden said. “This bill is going nowhere in the Senate.”</p><p>And the White House said President Joe Biden would veto the bill if it gets to his desk, saying that the wealthiest 1% of Americans hide about 20% of their income so they don't have to pay taxes on it, shifting more of the tax burden to the middle class.</p><p>"With their first economic legislation of the new Congress, House Republicans are making clear that their top economic priority is to allow the rich and multibillion-dollar corporations to skip out on their taxes, while making life harder for ordinary, middle-class families that pay the taxes they owe," the White House said.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Alberto Pezzali)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>From the book's opening citation of William Faulkner, to <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/prince-harry">Prince Harry's</a> passionate bond with his wife Meghan, you could almost call the Duke of Sussex's memoir “The Americanization of Prince Harry."</p><p>Bereaved boy, troubled teen, wartime soldier, unhappy royal — <a href="https://apnews.com/article/prince-harry-book-details-ce879703cbc92372e4736313c6cab941">many facets of Prince Harry</a> are revealed in his <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-united-kingdom-prince-harry-books-and-literature-nonfiction-7082bf624e4b43826d0cc39ce69f961f">explosive memoir</a>, often in eyebrow-raising detail. Running throughout is Harry's desire to be a different kind of prince — the kind who talks about his feelings, eats fast food and otherwise doesn't hide beyond a prim facade.</p><p>Like an American.</p><p>From accounts of cocaine use and losing his virginity to raw family rifts, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/727238/spare-by-prince-harry-the-duke-of-sussex/">“Spare”</a> exposes deeply personal details about Harry and the wider royal family. Even Americans may flinch when he confides that a trip to the North Pole left him with frostbitten genitals that proved most irritating during his brother's wedding to Kate.</p><div id="90fa7fd38e2844a8b9fe97b50b2dfc03" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>BROTHERHOOD</p><p>The book opens with a famous quote from Faulkner, bard of the American South: “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.”</p><p>Harry’s story is dominated by his rivalry with elder brother <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/prince-william">Prince William</a> and the death of the boys’ mother, Princess Diana, in 1997. Harry, who was 12 at the time, has never forgiven the media for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/princess-diana-death-august-1997-coverage-3ebeb7abbd5dbf45232b727466b3f835">Diana’s death in a car crash</a> while being pursued by photographers.</p><p>The loss of his mother haunts the book, which Harry dedicates to Meghan, children Archie and Lili “and, of course, my mother.”</p><p>The opening chapter recounts how his father Prince Charles — now <a href="https://apnews.com/article/queen-elizabeth-ii-king-charles-iii-london-justin-welby-02706773db6242d41140c8ab6e95cc5d">King Charles III</a> — broke the news of his mother’s accident, but didn’t give his son a hug.</p><p>Harry reveals that years later he asked his driver to take him through the Pont de l’Alma tunnel in Paris, site of the fatal crash, hoping in vain that it would help end a “decade of unrelenting pain. He also says he once consulted a woman who claimed to have “powers” and to be able to pass on messages from Diana.</p><p>Harry adds that he and William both “pleaded” with their father not to marry his long-term paramour Camilla Parker-Bowles, worried she would become a “wicked stepmother.”</p><p>Harry also is tormented by his status as royal “spare” behind William, who is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/british-throne-line-of-succession-319ae52365a14d78c2614597c2868560">heir to the British throne</a>. Harry recounts a longstanding sibling rivalry that worsened after Harry began a relationship with Meghan, the American actor whom he married in 2018.</p><p>He says that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/prince-harry-memoir-prince-william-allegations-e32401f7e23cf38249e093dce5249523">during an argument in 2019</a>, William called Meghan “difficult” and “rude" (the kind of insults an upper class Englishman might reserve for Americans), then grabbed him by the collar and knocked him down. Harry suffered cuts and bruises from landing on a dog bowl.</p><div id="87f51476e017417f92fa2e98d937713d" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Harry says Charles implored the brothers to make up, saying after the funeral of Prince Philip in 2021: “Please, boys — don’t make my final years a misery.</p><p>Neither Buckingham Palace, which represents King Charles III, nor William’s Kensington Palace office has commented on any of the allegations.</p><p>ADMIRATION FOR GRANDPARENTS</p><p>Harry writes with admiration and some affection about Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip. He remembers Phillip's “many passions —carriage driving, barbecuing, shooting, food beer," and above all how he “embraced life," as did his mother. “Maybe that was why he'd been such a fan" of Princess Diana, Harry recalls.</p><p>Meanwhile, he acknowledges being intimidated at times by his grandmother, if only because she was the Queen. She is no more helpful than anyone else in containing the media leaks, but she is often seen as sympathetic to his wishes, never more so than when she approved of his marriage of Meghan.</p><p>Harry also sees her as an engaging, even humorous person beyond her otherwise proper bearing. Reflecting on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/queen-elizabeth-ii-health-update-b2578aa91c3fef9c5d6ad4a557bf63e4">her death last year</a> he remembers whispering jokes into her ear or convincing her to participate in a widely seen promotional video of the Invictus Games, in which she one-ups the Obamas in a sparring contest.</p><p>“She was a natural comedienne," he writes, calling her “wicked sense of humor" a prized confidence between the two. “In every photo of us, whenever we're exchanging a glance, making solid eye contact, it's clear. We had secrets."</p><div id="d82c867532784307beb8b75cb03686bd" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>WILD TEENAGE YEARS</p><p>The memoir suggests the media’s party-boy image of Harry during his teen and young adult years was well-deserved.</p><p>Harry describes how he lost his virginity at 17 — in a field behind a pub to an older woman who loved horses and treated the teenage prince like a “young stallion.” It was, he says, an “inglorious episode.”</p><p>He also says he took cocaine several times starting at the same age, in order to "feel different.” He also acknowledges using cannabis and magic mushrooms — which made him hallucinate that a toilet was talking to him.</p><p>ARMY REVELATIONS</p><div id="af94f18acaba436991608970fbff89af" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Harry offers extensive memories of his decade in the British Army, serving twice in Afghanistan. He says that on his second tour, as an Apache helicopter co-pilot and gunner in 2012-2013, he killed 25 Taliban militants. Harry says he felt neither satisfaction nor shame about his actions, and in the heat of battle regarded enemy combatants as pieces being removed from a chessboard, “Bads taken away before they could kill Goods."</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/prince-harry-afghanistan-service-claims-1c497d35a8211dc0366429856a539e2a">Veterans criticized the comments</a> and said they could increase the security risk for Harry. Retired Col. Richard Kemp said it was “an error of judgment,” and regarding enemy fighters as chess pieces is “not the way the British Army trains people.”</p><p>“I think that sort of comment that doesn’t reflect reality is misleading and potentially valuable to those people who wish the British forces and British government harm,” he told the BBC.</p><p>The Taliban <a href="https://apnews.com/article/taliban-takeover-afghanistan-what-to-know-1a74c9cd866866f196c478aba21b60b6">returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021</a>, and Harry's words have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-nato-politics-taliban-prince-harry-603f12d84207e994dc16e556a556960d">drawn protests in the country</a>. Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi called the Western invasion of Afghanistan “odious” and said Harry’s comments “are a microcosm of the trauma experienced by Afghans at the hands of occupation forces who murdered innocents without any accountability.”</p><p>A REGULAR GUY</p><p>Yes, he's a Prince, but he isn't above stopping by for burgers and fries at an In-N-Out, or getting clothes from a chain outlet. He's also a compulsive watcher of “Friends" and relates most to the wisecracking Chandler Bing, played by Matthew Perry. And because he's a prince, he got to meet another “Friends" star, Courteney Cox, and indulge in chocolate psychedelic mushrooms at her Los Angeles home.</p><p>THE REAL VILLAIN</p><p>Harry shares painful words about his father and brother, but his real anger is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/king-charles-iii-princess-diana-meghan-markle-prince-harry-royalty-0f1fb22ed38f77b99970e7739ac52f98">directed at the British media</a>, and at those <a href="https://apnews.com/article/prince-harry-book-meghan-royals-4141be64bcd1521d1d5cf0f9b65e20b5">within the royal circle</a> who cooperated and otherwise stood aside. While Charles remains apparently indifferent to the press, the rest of the family is obsessed with media coverage, Harry writes, himself as much as any of them. He expresses despair over what he calls endlessly false stories about him, the racist caricatures of his wife and of the press' unnerving knowledge of his whereabouts and private correspondence. “One has to have a relationship with the press," he is told by the royal staff.</p><div id="6a6812a9e78743caa4ed6f0ad90a606f" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>PERSONAL JOURNEY</p><p>Harry credits Meghan with changing the way he sees the world and himself. He says he was “awash in isolation and privilege” and had no understanding of unconscious bias before he met her.</p><p>The young prince notoriously wore a Nazi uniform to a costume party in 2005, and claims in the book that William and his now-wife Kate encouraged the choice of outfit and “howled” with laughter when they saw it. He was recorded using a racist term about a fellow soldier of Pakistani descent in 2006, but says he did not know the word was a slur and that the soldier was not offended.</p><div id="427f92bd170348f095545ae6d5f4e29d" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Meghan and Harry cited the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ian-murray-quits-over-response-meghan-harry-interview-101677e9b1515fc69b872010b2b862fc">U.K. media’s treatment of the biracial American actor</a> as one of the main reasons for their decision to quit royal duties and move to the U.S. in 2020.</p><p>The book gives no sign that royal family relations will be repaired soon. Harry told ITV in an interview to promote the book that he wants reconciliation, but that there must be “accountability” first.</p><p>In the final pages, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/queen-elizabeth-ii-king-charles-iii-princess-diana-entertainment-c0a0c4e58abc455619b82b381fda40e4">Harry describes how he and William walked side by side</a> during the funeral procession of Queen Elizabeth II in September, but spoke barely a word to one another.</p><p>“The following afternoon, Meg and I left for America,” he says.</p>]]></description>

His bleak, but comic perspective was shaped in part by his years growing up in wartime Yugoslavia, leading him to observe that “The world is old, it was always old.” His poems were usually short and pointed, with surprising and sometimes jarring shifts in mood and imagery, as if to mirror the cruelty and randomness he had learned early on.</p><p>In “Two Dogs,” Simic writes of how one dog in “some Southern town” and another in the New Hampshire woods reminded him of a “little white dog” who became “entangled” in the feet of marching German soldiers. “Reading History” is a sketch of the “vast, dark and impenetrable” skies for those “led to their death.” In “Help Wanted,” life is a cosmic joke, and the narrator a willing dupe:</p><div id="afs:Card:958899307023" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="3c3114c0f390d2a50b5a0e1883211bca">Hub peek embed (apf-entertainment) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>They asked for a knife</p><p>I come running</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>They need a lamb</p><p>I introduce myself as the lamb</p><p>But Simic also loved wordplay (“The insomniac’s brain is a choo-choo train”), catcalls (“America, I shouted at the radio/Even at 2 a.m. you are a loony bin!”) and the interplay of great thoughts and everyday follies: “What was that fragment of Heraclitus/You were trying to remember/As you stepped on the butcher’s cat?” he wrote in “The Friends of Heraclitus.” In “Transport,” sex becomes a near-literal feast of the senses:</p><p>In the frying pan</p><p>On the stove</p><p>I found my love</p><p>And me naked</p><p>Chopped onions</p><p>Fell on our heads</p><p>And made us cry</p><p>It’s like a parade,</p><p>I told her, confetti</p><p>When some guy</p><p>Reaches the moon</p><p>His notable books included “The World Doesn’t End,” winner of the Pulitzer in 1990; “Walking the Black Cat,” a National Book Award finalist in 1996; “Unending Blues” and such recent collections as “The Lunatic” and “Scribbled in the Dark.” In 2005, he received the Griffin Poetry Prize and was praised by judges as “a magician, a conjuror,” master of “a disarming, deadpan precision, which should never be mistaken for simplicity.” He was fluent in several languages and translated the works of other poets from French, Serbian, Croatian, Macedonian, and Slovenian.</p><p>His 2022 collection “No Land in Sight" presented a dark vision of contemporary life, such as the poem “Come Spring” and its warning: “Don't let that birdie in the tree/Fool you with its pretty song/The wicked are back from hell."</p><p>In 1964, Simic married fashion designer Helene Dubin, with whom he had two children. He became an American citizen in 1971 and two years later joined the faculty of the University of New Hampshire, where he remained for decades.</p><p>Born Dusan Simic in Belgrade in 1938, the year before World War II began, he would describe his youth as “a small, nonspeaking part/In a bloody epic.” His father fled to Italy in 1942 and was apart from the family for years. Home was so oppressive that Simic came to see the war as a needed escape.</p><p>“The war ended the day before May 9, 1945, which happened to be my birthday,” he told the Paris Review in 2005. “I was playing in the street. I went up to the apartment to get a drink of water where my mother and our neighbors were listening to the radio. They said, ‘War is over,’ and apparently I looked at them puzzled and said, ‘Now there won’t be any more fun!’ In wartime, there’s no parental supervision; the grown-ups are so busy with their lives, the kids can run free.”</p><p>Simic would refer to Hitler and Stalin as his “travel agents.” Nazi rule gave way to Soviet-backed oppression and Simic emigrated to France with his mother and brother in the mid-1950s, then soon to the U.S. His family settled in Chicago, where his high school was once attended by Ernest Hemingway, and he became interested in poetry — for the art and for the girls. His parents unable to pay for college, he spent a decade working at jobs ranging from a payroll clerk to house painter while taking night classes at the University of Chicago and eventually New York University, from which he graduated in 1966 with a degree in Russian studies.</p><p>His first book, “What the Grass Says," came out in 1967. He followed with “Somewhere Among Us a Stone is Taking Notes” and “Dismantling the Silence,” and was soon averaging a book a year. A New York Times review from 1978 would note his gift for conveying “a complex of perceptions and feelings” in just a few lines.</p><p>“Of all the things ever said about poetry, the axiom that less is more has made the biggest and the most lasting impression on me,” Simic told Granta in 2013. “I have written many short poems in my life, except ‘written’ is not the right word to describe how they came into existence. Since it’s not possible to sit down and write an eight-line poem that’ll be vast for its size, these poems are assembled over a long period of time from words and images floating in my head.”</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Andre Penner)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>SALVADOR, Brazil (AP) — Thousands of Brazilians who support former president Jair Bolsonaro invaded the Supreme Court, presidential palace and Congress on Jan. 8 in an episode that closely resembled the U.S. Capitol insurrection in 2021. The groups were able to break through police barricades along the capital Brasilia’s main boulevard and storm the buildings, damage furniture, smash windows and destroy artworks. As they unleashed chaos in the capital, Bolsonaro was holed up in Florida, home to his ally, former U.S. President Donald Trump. The incident sparked accusations that Bolsonaro's actions stoked the flames of dissent and ultimately produced the uprising. </p><p>WHO ARE THESE PROTESTERS, AND WHAT DO THEY WANT?</p><p>The protesters are hardcore Bolsonaro supporters, some of whom have been camped outside a military headquarters in Brasilia since Bolsonaro lost the Oct. 30 presidential election and reject the race’s results. Others traveled to Brasilia for the weekend on buses. They have been demanding military intervention to oust newly inaugurated President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, alleging he is a thief who will lead the country into communism, and restore Bolsonaro to power. </p><p>HOW DID BRAZIL GET TO THIS POINT?</p><div id="afs:Card:272901778982" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="29fad1e6c79a5737641932c939021e62">Hub peek embed (JairBolsonaro) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Throughout his administration, Bolsonaro trained fire at Supreme Court justices for opening investigations targeting him and his allies. He repeatedly singled out Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who presided over the electoral authority during the election, and at one point pushed Brazil to the brink of an institutional crisis by threatening to disobey any of de Moraes' future rulings. </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Bolsonaro also sowed doubt about the reliability of Brazil's electronic voting machines, then declined to concede defeat. After his loss, he largely vanished from view, though he addressed his supporters once to tell them they had the power in their hands and that he controls the armed forces. His supporters maintained hope Bolsonaro or the armed forces would lead an intervention to overturn the results. </p><p>WHAT HAS BOLSONARO CLAIMED ABOUT THE VOTING SYSTEM AND ELECTIONS? </p><p>Bolsonaro insisted the electronic voting system should feature a printed receipt in order to enable audits, but Congress' Lower House in 2021 voted down his proposal for that change and electoral authorities say the results can already be verified. Security experts consider electronic voting less secure than hand-marked paper ballots because they leave no auditable paper trail. Brazil’s system is, however, closely scrutinized and domestic authorities and international observers have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-caribbean-voting-donald-trump-elections-fb592d5165e5bb07c0426199d86b5787">never found evidence of it being exploited to commit fraud</a> since its adoption in 1996.</p><p>After the 2022 elections, Bolsonaro and his party <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-caribbean-brazil-c03ec4f0e1d65fc81c02a2d90181cf48">petitioned the electoral authority</a> to nullify millions of votes cast on the majority of voting machines that featured a software bug — the machines lacked individual identification numbers in their internal logs. The request didn’t say how the bug might affect results, and independent experts said that it would not undermine reliability in any way. The electoral authority's president <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-caribbean-brazil-90bf6942d59fde9707c2f7b7e6bd72c4">swiftly dismissed the request</a> and imposed a multi-million dollar fine on the party for what he called a bad-faith effort.</p><p>WHAT ARE BOLSONARO’S TIES TO TRUMP AND HIS ALLIES? </p><p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump was one of Bolsonaro’s few foreign allies and Bolsonaro often exalted his American counterpart’s leadership, even posting photos of himself watching Trump’s addresses. </p><p>Bolsonaro and his lawmaker son Eduardo visited Trump at Mar-a-Lago, and both attended dinners at the house of Steve Bannon. The longtime Trump ally amplified Bolsonaro's claims about the electronic voting system before the October vote and, after the Jan. 8 uprising in Brasilia, called the protesters “Brazilian freedom fighters” in a video on social media. </p><p>Eduardo Bolsonaro has repeatedly attended the Conservative Political Action Conference in the U.S., positioning himself as the international face of the right-wing movement led by his father and making inroads with his American counterparts. Jason Miller, the former Trump campaign strategist, also met with Eduardo in Brazil. On the eve of the Jan. 6 insurrection in the U.S. Capitol, Eduardo was in Washington, and met with Ivanka Trump and My Pillow chief executive Mike Lindell. </p><p>After Trump lost his reelection bid, then-President Bolsonaro waited five weeks before recognizing Joe Biden’s victory and was one of the final world leaders to do so.</p><p>WHY IS BOLSONARO IN THE U.S.? </p><p>Bolsonaro flew to Florida two days before Lula’s Jan. 1 inauguration, when the outgoing president traditionally bestows the presidential sash to his successor. Instead, Bolsonaro took up temporary residence in the home of a Brazilian former mixed martial arts fighter outside Orlando. He hasn’t specified the reasons for his departure, and analysts have speculated it marks an attempt to avoid potential prosecution in connection with several ongoing investigations targeting him, blame from backers for not mobilizing the armed forces or responsibility for his supporters’ actions. </p>]]></description>

(Jan. 9)</p>    <p>Enraged protesters broke into government buildings that are the very symbol of their country’s democracy. Driven by conspiracy theories about their candidate's loss in the last election, they smashed windows, sifted through the desks of lawmakers and trashed the highest offices in the land in a rampage that lasted hours before order could be restored.</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-jair-bolsonaro-politics-brazil-government-8766c0ad2fcc4ae7c8bf1aa7f9aaa0ec">Sunday's attack</a> by supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil's capital drew immediate parallels with the <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/capitol-siege">Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol</a> by former President Donald Trump's backers two years and two days earlier. </p><p>The two populist former presidents shared a close political alliance with an overlapping cast of supporters — some of whom helped spread <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-michael-pence-electoral-college-elections-health-2d9bd47a8bd3561682ac46c6b3873a10">Trump's lies</a> about <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-claims-biden-won-explained-bd53b14ce871412b462cb3fe2c563f18">losing his re-election</a> due to voter fraud and later parroted Bolsonaro's similar claims after his own re-election loss last fall. Bolsonaro was among the last world leaders to recognize Joe Biden's victory in 2020.</p><p>“The U.S. example of election denying and creating alternative facts, and radicalizing law enforcement, and of openly disparaging democratic institutions was a template that I don’t think Bolsonaro et al would have come up with on their own,” said Scott Hamilton, a former U.S. diplomat in Brazil.</p><div id="afs:Card:272901778982" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="22a083f0d08bb9d1d93b67871a103b0c">Hub peek embed (JairBolsonaro) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Still, experts warn against conflating the two attacks.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>There were “undeniable similarities” to Jan. 6, said Graham Brookie, senior director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensics Research Lab, which tracks disinformation around the globe.</p><p>“The imagery. A lot of the calls for action on social media are very, very similar,” he said. “But there’s a huge caveat. Democracy in Brazil is a lot different than democracy here in the United States. The culture, the context, even the institutions are really different, and that really matters.”</p><p>Many of the connections are out in the open. Bolsonaro’s lawmaker son, Eduardo, in 2019 signed on to work with Trump adviser Steve Bannon’s international populist movement. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-steve-bannon-congress-donald-trump-sentencing-36d412eba9e1609a030859852378ae3d">Bannon</a> became one of the loudest proponents of Trump's election lies in 2020 and has amplified Bolsonaro's claims about rigged voting machines.</p><div id="1b9be458793f40669534c5e21b49ce86" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Trump was one of Bolsonaro’s few foreign allies, and Bolsonaro often exalted his American counterpart’s leadership, even posting photos of himself watching Trump’s addresses. He and his son visited Trump at Mar-a-Lago, and both attended dinners at Bannon's house.</p><p>After Sunday's rioting in Brasilia, Bannon called the protesters “Brazilian freedom fighters” in a video on social media.</p><p>The Conservative Political Action Conference, a key gathering of right-wing activists that has been a hotbed of pro-Trump enthusiasm, met in Sao Paulo in September. One of the attendees, former Trump spokesman Jason Miller, was later detained by Brazilian authorities before leaving the country.</p><p>"We do not advocate violence but believe peaceful protests are proper and that the situation in Brazil should be fully investigated,” Matt Schlapp, CPAC’s lead organizer, said in a statement to The Associated Press in reaction to the weekend rioting.</p><p>Protesters stormed Brazil's Congress, Supreme Court and presidential palace, with some calling for the military to oust President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Others waved banners suggesting they believed claims that voting machines were programmed to steal the election from Bolsonaro, reminiscent of signs brandished on Jan. 6 promoting similar conspiracy theories in the U.S.</p><p>The images of Brazilian protesters fighting with police guarding the complex, breaking into government offices and searching the desks of opposition lawmakers added to the flashbacks about the attack on the U.S. Capitol.</p><p>The attacks followed months of Bolsonaro <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-elections-caribbean-voting-brazil-8acf78e1e58650424b1dec4ecfc35ce4">exploiting fears about election integrity</a> without offering evidence, similar to Trump in 2020. </p><p>In November, Bolsonaro <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-caribbean-brazil-c03ec4f0e1d65fc81c02a2d90181cf48">blamed his loss on a software bug</a> and called for most electronic votes to be annulled. Independent experts rejected his claim, and Bolsonaro’s bid to annul the votes failed.</p><p>Social media still throbbed with misinformation about the election after it ended, and posts urging Brazilians to converge on their capital city on Sunday to challenge the election results went viral on TikTok, Facebook, Telegram and other platforms. One post racked up more than 800,000 views just since Friday, according to an analysis by Aos Fatos, a Brazilian fact-checking organization.</p><p>Wendy Via, president of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, said Sunday’s riots are yet another example of how online misinformation and rhetoric can spur violence if they’re deployed by a leader with a large enough audience.</p><p>“We did see this coming,” Via said. “This doesn’t just happen in Brazil, or the United States. This is a global problem. Should we compare what happened in Brazil to Jan. 6? I say 100%, because it’s the same playbook.”</p><p>But there are important differences between the two attacks and the forces in the two countries that propelled them. </p><p>“This was not part of an orchestrated movement to overturn the election results,” said Christopher Garman, managing director of the Americas for the Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting group. “It's a little bit of a different animal” than Jan. 6, he said. </p><p>On Jan. 6, 2021, Trump was still president, and he urged his supporters at his rally on the ellipse to march to the Capitol and stop Congress' ratification of Joe Biden's victory. In Brasilia, the protest occurred on a Sunday, when few were in government offices and Bolsonaro had already relinquished power.</p><p>Bolsonaro <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-florida-state-government-brazil-099db80c6511119b534ca17747f871fe?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=TopNews&amp;utm_campaign=position_05">had even left the country</a> — to Trump's adopted home state of Florida, where he appears to have been staying in the Orlando area. On Monday, he checked into a hospital there, complaining of abdominal pains.</p><p>Garman said Bolsonaro's hand may have been checked by Brazil's supreme court, which has been aggressively penalizing misinformation about the election to the point of censoring social media accounts and news reports that it found misleading. Bolsonaro knew that if he pushed too hard, the court could rule he could not run for public office again.</p><p>“If he had followed the Trump path, his political rights would have already been suspended,” Garman said.</p><p>The situation in Brazil is also more fraught than in the U.S. Systemic corruption is a greater concern in that country, as is the stability of what is still a fairly young democracy after decades of authoritarian rule that lasted through the 1980s. The man who beat Bolsonaro, Lula, is a former president who was imprisoned on corruption charges during Bolsonaro's initial 2018 election, only to have his conviction annulled by Brazil's supreme court.</p><p>The anti-establishment anger may sound familiar to those who follow U.S. politics — a hyper-polarized political environment and a weakened center, along with mounting distrust in both institutions and those on the other side.</p><p>“It's not healthy for any democracy to have these levels of distrust,” Garman said.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers David Biller in Rio de Janeiro and Joshua Goodman in Miami contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

(Jan. 10)</p>    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department is reviewing a batch of potentially classified documents found in the Washington office space of President Joe Biden's former institute, the White House said Monday.</p><p>Special counsel to the president Richard Sauber said “a small number of documents with classified markings” were discovered as Biden's personal attorneys were clearing out the offices of the Penn Biden Center, where the president kept an office after he left the vice presidency in 2017 until shortly before he launched his 2020 presidential campaign in 2019. The documents were found on Nov. 2, 2022, in a “locked closet” in the office, Sauber said.</p><p>Sauber said the attorneys immediately alerted the White House Counsel's office, who notified the National Archives and Records Administration — which took custody of the documents the next day. </p><p>“Since that discovery, the President’s personal attorneys have cooperated with the Archives and the Department of Justice in a process to ensure that any Obama-Biden Administration records are appropriately in the possession of the Archives,” Sauber said. </p><p>A person who is familiar with the matter but not authorized to discuss it publicly said Attorney General Merrick Garland asked U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois John Lausch to review the matter after the Archives referred the issue to the department. Lausch is one of the few U.S. attorneys to be held over from former President Donald Trump's administration. </p><div id="afs:Card:130243251955" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="812ef44a5333f6d93423a67a683fa024">Hub peek embed (JoeBiden) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Irrespective of the Justice Department review, the revelation that Biden potentially mishandled classified or presidential records could prove to be a political headache for the president, who called Trump's decision to keep hundreds of such records at his private club in Florida <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-taiwan-biden-government-and-politics-mar-a-lago-2474104aa0fd9ffaa8de33538813c84e">“irresponsible."</a></p><p>Trump weighed in Monday on his social media site, asking, “When is the FBI going to raid the many homes of Joe Biden, perhaps even the White House?”</p><p>The revelation comes as Republicans have taken control of the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-us-republican-party-united-states-house-of-representatives-kevin-mccarthy-b9fcfd11427a695fe2eb49e36988f1a0">House of Representatives</a> and are promising to launch widespread investigations of Biden's administration.</p><p>It also may complicate the Justice Department's consideration on whether to bring charges against Trump, who has launched a repeat bid for the White House in 2024 and has repeatedly claimed that the department's inquiry of his own conduct amounted to “corruption."</p><div id="71e25217d63244a0905832c8645bd802" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>The National Archives did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. Spokespeople for Garland and Lausch declined to comment. </p><p>Rep. James Comer, the new GOP chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Monday that the revelation raised questions about the Justice Department’s handling of the Trump probe.</p><p>“Is the White House going to be raided tonight? Are they going to raid the Bidens?” he asked reporters. “This is further concern that there’s a two-tier justice system within the DOJ with how they treat Republicans versus Democrats, certainly how they treat the former president versus the current president.”</p><p>His Democratic counterpart, Rep. Jamie Raskin, said Biden's attorneys “appear to have taken immediate and proper action.”</p><p>“I have confidence that the Attorney General took the appropriate steps to ensure the careful review of the circumstances surrounding the possession and discovery of these documents and make an impartial decision about any further action that may be needed,” he added.</p><p>Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, chair of the powerful House Judiciary Committee, said Monday that the American public deserved to know earlier about the revelation of classified documents.</p><p>“They knew about this a week before the election, maybe the American people should have known that,” Jordan told reporters. “They certainly knew about the the raid on Mar-a-Lago 91 days before this election, but nice if on November 2, the country would have known that there were classified documents at the Biden Center.”</p><p>Jordan is among House Republicans pushing for the creation of a “select subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal government” within the Judiciary Committee.</p><p>Votes on creating that committee are expected as soon as this week, setting up a showdown between Republicans and the prosecutors leading various federal investigations, including the ones into Trump.</p><p>It wasn't immediately clear why the White House didn't disclose the discovery of the documents or the DOJ review sooner. CBS was first to report Monday on the discovery of the potentially classified documents.</p><p>The Justice Department for months has been investigating the retention of roughly 300 documents that were marked as classified and were recovered from the Trump's <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/mar-a-lago">Florida estate.</a> In that instance, prosecutors say, representatives of Trump resisted requests to give back the full stash of classified documents and failed to fully comply with a subpoena that sought their return.</p><p>FBI agents in August served a search warrant at the Mar-a-Lago property, removing 33 boxes and containers.</p><p>That investigation is being led by special counsel Jack Smith. Prosecutors have interviewed an array of Trump associates and have been using a grand jury to hear evidence.</p><p>It is not clear when a decision when will be made on whether Trump, or anyone else, should be charged.</p><p>The think tank, formally known as the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, is affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania and continues to operate independently of the Biden administration.</p><p>—</p><p>Associated Press writers Nomaan Merchant, Eric Tucker and Farnoush Amiri in Washington and Michael Tarm in Chicago contributed.</p><p>This story was first published on Jan. 9, 2023. It was updated on Jan. 10, 2023 to correct that the number of boxes seized by the FBI during its August search of Mar-a-Lago was 33 boxes and containers, not 15.</p>]]></description>

Now House Republicans will try to govern.</p><p>Speaker <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/kevin-mccarthy">Kevin McCarthy</a> passed his first tests late Monday as the Republicans approved their <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-us-republican-party-office-of-congressional-ethics-pandemics-60b4f098523b982b549823f4b3e8f9e4">rules package</a> for governing House operations, typically a routine step on Day One that stretched into the second week of the new majority. It was approved 220-213, a party-line vote with one Republican opposed.</p><p>Next, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-internal-revenue-service-us-republican-party-house-of-representatives-64692090ef20e35a59ba1ea7d21a9eea">House Republicans easily passed their first bill</a> — legislation to cut funding that is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-ap-fact-check-congress-government-and-politics-11eae023a3dc3a04584371843234cab7">supposed to bolster the Internal Revenue Service</a>. The Republicans' IRS bill ran into a snag ahead of votes because the budget office announced that rather than save money, it would add $114 billion to the federal deficit. The measure flew through on another party-line vote, 218-210, though it has almost no chance of passage in the Democratic-controlled Senate.</p><p>It was an effective start to what could otherwise be a new era of potentially crisis governing. House Republicans are expected to be lurching from one standoff to the next after <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-kevin-mccarthy-house-of-representatives-4922d22689eb79d5d05c1b49ca733123?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=TopNews&amp;utm_campaign=position_04">last week's raucous speaker's race</a> that showcased the challenges ahead as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-house-of-representatives-kevin-mccarthy-government-e986c620149b72030bb418bd5fadb4a2">McCarthy confronts a rebellious majority</a> as well as the limits of President Joe Biden's remaining agenda on Capitol Hill.</p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="b9fcfd11427a695fe2eb49e36988f1a0">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>With sky-high ambitions for a hard-right conservative agenda but only a narrow hold on the majority, which enables just a few holdouts to halt proceedings, the Republicans are rushing headlong into an uncertain, volatile start of the new session. They want to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-inflation-donald-trump-business-9af868065b776b21f81fa73e7bafb97d">investigate Biden</a>, slash federal spending and beef up competition with China. </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>But first McCarthy, backed by former President Donald Trump, needs to show the Republican majority can keep up with basics of governing.</p><p>“You know, it’s a little more difficult when you go into a majority and maybe the margins aren’t high,” McCarthy acknowledged after winning the speaker's vote. “Having the disruption now really built the trust with one another and learned how to work together.”</p><p>But McCarthy himself announced Monday evening's final vote tally on the IRS bill to applause from his side of the aisle. “Promises made. Promises kept,” he said in a statement.</p><p>As McCarthy gaveled open the House on Monday as the new speaker, the Republicans launched debate on the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-us-republican-party-office-of-congressional-ethics-pandemics-60b4f098523b982b549823f4b3e8f9e4">Rules package,</a> a hard-fought 55-page document that McCarthy negotiated with conservative holdouts to win over their votes to make him House speaker.</p><p>Central to the package is the provision the conservative Freedom Caucus wanted that reinstates a longstanding rule that allows any one lawmaker make a motion to “vacate the chair” — a vote to oust the speaker. Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi had done away with the rule when Democrats took charge in 2019 because conservatives had held it over past Republican speakers as a threat.</p><p>Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Va., said the rules are about “getting back to the basics.”</p><p>But that's not the only change. There are other provisions the conservatives extracted from McCarthy that weaken the power of the speaker's office and turn over more control of the legislative business to rank-and-file lawmakers, particularly those far-right lawmakers who won concessions.</p><p>The Republicans are allowing more Freedom Caucus lawmakers on the Rules committee that shapes legislative debates. Those members promise more open and free-flowing debates and are insisting on 72 hours to read legislation ahead of votes. </p><p>But it's an open question whether the changes being approved will make the House more transparent in its operations or grind it to a halt, as happened last week when McCarthy battled through four days and 14 failed ballots before finally winning the speaker's gavel.</p><p>Many Republicans defended the standoff over the speaker's gavel, which was finally resolved in the post-midnight hours of Saturday morning on the narrowest of votes — one of the longest speaker's race showdowns in U.S. history.</p><p>“A little temporary conflict is necessary in this town in order to stop this town from rolling over the American people,” Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said over the weekend on CNN. </p><p>On Monday, Roy praised the new rules he helped craft, saying he could file a motion “right now” to demand a vote on the speaker — as it has been through much of House history.</p><p>But heading into Monday evening's voting on the rules package, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-kevin-mccarthy-house-of-representatives-4922d22689eb79d5d05c1b49ca733123?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=TopNews&amp;utm_campaign=position_06">at least two other Republicans</a> raised objections about the backroom deals McCarthy had cut, leaving it unclear if there would be enough GOP support for passage. In the end, only Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas voted against.</p><p>Democrats decried the new rules as caving to the demands of the far-right aligned with Trump's Make American Great Again agenda.</p><p>“These rules are not a serious attempt at governing,” said Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Rules Committee. Rather, he said, it's a “ransom note from far right.”</p><p>Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., focused his criticism on the GOP's so-called Holman Rule, which would allow Congress to rescind the pay of individual federal employees: “This is no way to govern."</p><p>McCarthy commands a slim 222-seat Republican majority, which means on any given vote he can only lose four GOP detractors or the legislation will fail, if all Democrats are opposed. </p><p>The new rules are making McCarthy's job even tougher. For example, Republicans are doing away with the proxy voting that Democrats under former Speaker Nancy Pelosi put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. That means McCarthy must demand greater attendance and participation on every vote with almost no absences allowed for family emergencies or other circumstances.</p><p>“Members of Congress have to show up and work again,” said Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La.</p><p>With the Senate still narrowly held by Democrats, the divided Congress could still be a time of bipartisan deal-making. Monday saw a group of Republican and Democratic senators head to the southern U.S. border with Mexico as they try to develop an immigration overhaul to curb the flow of migrants. </p><p>But more often a split Congress produces gridlock.</p><p>The Republicans have been here before, just over a decade ago, when the tea party class swept to the majority in 2011, booting Pelosi from the speaker's office and rushing into an era of hardball politics that shut down the government and threatened a federal debt default.</p><p>McCarthy was a key player in those battles, having recruited the tea party class when he was the House GOP's campaign chairman. He tried and failed to take over for Republican John Boehner in 2015 when the beleaguered House speaker abruptly retired rather than face a potential vote by conservatives on his ouster. </p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Kevin Freking and Hope Yen contributed to this report. </p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/ Matt Rourke)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Lawmakers no longer have to walk through metal detectors before gaining access to the House floor. And any time they do vote, they will have to do so in person — no more voting by proxy from home.</p><p>Those are just some of the changes being made by the now <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-kevin-mccarthy-house-of-representatives-4922d22689eb79d5d05c1b49ca733123">GOP-led House</a> that had chafed at some of the restrictions Democrats put in place as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Jan. 6 insurrection.</p><p>A look at some of the key changes Republicans adopted Monday that will affect floor proceedings and dictate their priorities in the 118th Congress.</p><p>ENDING PROXY VOTING</p><p>As the pandemic surged in the U.S. and the death toll reached more than 80,000, the House <a href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-donald-trump-politics-f6081d31f1e6e7ca5f541df51787a491">approved new rules</a> allowing lawmakers to vote by proxy. Under the process, they assigned their vote to another lawmaker who then announced on the House floor how the absent lawmaker was voting on a particular bill.</p><p>Republicans <a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-health-business-congress-voting-414cb594073bab735552c6918c308470">opposed the change</a> from the start, though many used proxy voting after it went into effect. And hewing to their campaign promise, they made sure the House rules provide no option for remote voting.</p><p>Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., the House majority leader, said ending proxy voting would increase collaboration and speed up the voting process.</p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="60b4f098523b982b549823f4b3e8f9e4">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“It’s about making Congress work again where people have to show up and do their jobs in person like everybody else in the real world has to,” Scalise said.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>PRESSURE ON THE SPEAKER</p><p>House rules give lawmakers the ability to remove the speaker from the job through what's known as a motion to vacate. A majority vote of all House members would be needed for the speaker to be ousted.</p><p>House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., hoping to appease some on the hard right, agreed to give as few as five Republican members the ability to initiate a vote to remove him. But when that wasn't good enough for some of the more conservative members of the conference, he agreed to reduce that threshold to one — the threshold that historically has been the norm.</p><p>Proponents of the one-person threshold said it promotes accountability, noting its long history in the House. The last use of the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/eeb516db1105468896641ef0cda238a9">motion was in 2015</a>, when then-Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, a Republican who later became Donald Trump's chief of staff, introduced a resolution to declare the speaker's office vacant. Two months later, Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said he would be stepping down.</p><p>Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., calls the move to go back to the lower threshold “allowing the far-right to hold the incoming speaker hostage." And some moderate Republicans agree with that assessment.</p><p>But Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., who initially opposed McCarthy's speakership bid before ultimately supporting him, said the bare-minimum threshold had been in place since the 1800s and is an important tool that was in force until House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took the gavel.</p><p>“In the business arena, if a CEO is not doing the job, you get fired," Norman said. “Same thing in politics. We're not immune." </p><p>REVAMPING ETHICS OFFICE</p><p>Republicans are proposing major changes to the Office of Congressional Ethics, which initiates reviews of ethics complaints and when appropriate refers its findings to the House Committee on Ethics. Only the latter has the authority to recommend discipline.</p><p>But the office initiating the review plays a critical role in ensuring complaints from the public are followed up on. The board has six members and two alternates.</p><p>The Republican rules package would essentially gut the office, according to advocacy groups opposing the changes being made.</p><p>First, the new rules force three of the four Democrats who currently sit on the eight-member board to leave their positions immediately because they would be serving beyond an eight-year term limit that the rules package imposes. Second, it requires OCE staff to have been hired within 30 days of the rule's passage, making it difficult to assess and hire candidates for those jobs in such a brief window.</p><p>“Together, these changes weaken OCE to the point where the office would struggle to perform its core function, dismantling one of the only ways members of Congress are head accountable for ethics violations," said the Campaign Legal Center, which led a letter to lawmakers on behalf of about two dozen advocacy groups.</p><p>Members of both parties have chafed at the OCE's work over the years, complaining that complaints to the office are often politically motivated. The rule also directs the Ethics Committee to come up with a process to receive complaints directly from the public, rather than go through the OCE.</p><p>THE HOLMAN RULE</p><p>Another rule Republicans are resurrecting allows lawmakers to include language in appropriations bills that can rearrange an agency or slash specific positions or salaries.</p><p>Republicans say the rule is about enhancing accountability. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Va., said the rule was created in 1876 as a tool to cut spending by restructuring an agency. <a href="https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1851-1900/The-Holman-Rule/">Rep. William Holman thought spending</a> was out of control, Griffith said.</p><p>But the rule could also be used to target an individual over ideological differences, or say a special counsel, like the one overseeing the Justice Department’s investigation into the presence of classified documents at former President Donald Trump’s Florida estate. Of course, the Democratic-led Senate would have to go along for any such rescissions to take effect, which is highly unlikely. </p><p>The House Freedom Caucus even specifically named Dr. Anthony Fauci in calling for the rule's reinstatement. Fauci served as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases from 1984 to 2022, and his efforts to mitigate the damage from COVID-19 clashed with the views of some conservatives closely aligned with former President Donald Trump. </p><p>FIRE UP THE INVESTIGATIONS</p><p>The rules package calls for the House to vote on a resolution establishing a committee to investigate a number of things involving “strategic competition" between the U.S. and China as lawmakers take a more hardline approach with the Asian nation. </p><p>It also calls for creation of a “select subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal government" to be within the Judiciary Committee, which is headed by Rep.

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — An estimated $1.1 billion Mega Millions jackpot drawing Tuesday night has people lined up at convenience stores nationwide to buy tickets in longshot hopes of winning a massive prize, but shop and gas station owners selling the tickets also have a chance at a big-figure bonus.</p><p>State lotteries usually reward the owners of business that sell winning jackpot tickets thousands of dollars or even up to $1 million, even before those giant prizes are claimed.</p><p>FIRST THINGS FIRST, WHAT’S THE LATEST ON THE JACKPOT?</p><p>It seems no one can win the Mega Millions jackpot, so it keeps getting larger. The last time someone overcame the odds of 1 in 302.6 million and won the top prize was on Oct. 14. Since then there have been 24 straight drawings without anyone snagging the jackpot. The prize now <a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-lotteries-490f479fa200c10ceb97547b648f9483">ranks as the fifth-largest</a>, though it’s still only about half the size of a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lotteries-iowa-36ef3aefbbc37a15e1c5f172129fa6a6">record $2.04 billion Powerball jackpot</a>, won only a couple months ago by someone in California.</p><p>While it seems like forever since someone won, it's quite a ways from the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/iowa-6bdd1553e09dd6b8bb947b5a37e4c8fc">record of 41 straight drawings</a> that has occurred a couple of times, most recently leading up to that $2.04 billion California prize.</p><p>AND WHO IS THE LUCKY CALIFORNIAN?</p><div id="afs:Card:604728406135" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="cf5a7fc41ee94466bbe5894e1ec48615">Hub peek embed (apf-business) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>That remains a mystery. The California Lottery hasn’t announced a winner and says its policy is to not acknowledge whether anyone has claimed a prize until a supposedly winning ticket is vetted. All that’s clear is that a ticket matching all six numbers drawn Nov. 9 was sold at Joe’s Service Center in Altadena, an unincorporated community northeast of Los Angeles.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>ONE WINNER IN ALTADENA IS CLEAR.</p><p>Even if we don’t know anything about the Powerball winner, we know the service center owner, Joe Chahayed, was paid his $1 million bonus by lottery officials. Standing under a sign hoisted by the lottery that read, Billionaire Made Here, and surrounded by dozens of media representatives and well-wishers, Chahayed said he planned to spend the money on his five children and would donate some of it to help his community. He didn’t have a clue who had purchased the winning ticket.</p><p>“I wish I knew the person but most people who buy tickets from me are from the neighborhood. I hope one of them will be the winner,” he said.</p><p>HOW DOES THE RETAILER BONUS SYSTEM WORK?</p><p>The rules vary from state to state. Ohio, for example, pays up to $100,000 to retailers who sell jackpot-winning tickets. In Illinois, retailers can get up to a $500,000 bonus and in California, that benefit tops out at $1 million. The state lotteries say it's part of their efforts to encourage retailers to promote ticket sales. Some business owners say they also often see at least a temporary surge in business, as superstitious players stop off to buy their tickets at a spot where someone hit it big.</p><p>POWERBALL GETTING LARGER, TOO</p><p>Even as the Mega Millions jackpot grows ever larger, the top prize for the Powerball game is also nearing massive status. Ahead of a drawing Monday night, that prize stands at $340 million for players who opt to be paid through an annuity, doled out over 29 years.</p><p>IF YOU BUY A TICKET, DON’T FORGET ... </p><p>Whether you spend $2 or $200 on Mega Millions or Powerball tickets, your chance of winning are incredibly small. Powerball's odds of 1 in 292.2 million are a little better than those offered by Mega Millions, but they're still miserable. Can't get your mind around that? Andrew Swift, a mathematics professor at the University of Nebraska-Omaha, described it another way, noting the odds of winning for a person who buys a single ticket in either game are a little worse than flipping a coin and getting heads 28 straight times. </p><p>AND DON’T FORGET THIS, EITHER</p><p>Although the publicized annuity prize of $1.1 billion for winning Mega Millions or $340 million for Powerball jackpot get all the attention, winners rarely choose <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-iowa-e9446d1c0cded3f86348db3df374e7f6">such a long-term payment option</a>. They want their money right now. The cash payout is much smaller, at $568.7 million for Mega Millions and $178.2 million for Powerball.</p><p>So as you dream of buying a yacht, maybe for settle for just one rather than two.</p><p>Mega Millions is played in 45 states as well as Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>]]></description>

(Jan. 9)</p>    <p>ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — Bills safety Damar Hamlin said he returned to Buffalo on Monday “with a lot of love on my heart” to continue his recovery in a hospital there, a week after <a href="https://apnews.com/article/Bills-damar-hamlin-collapse-what-happened-d73a76f2f7f736b652e95896dfaa0900">going into cardiac arrest and having to be resuscitated</a> on the field during a game in Cincinnati.</p><p>Hamlin was discharged from the University of Cincinnati Medical Center in the morning and flown to western New York. He was listed in stable condition at Buffalo General Medical Center/Gates Vascular Institute.</p><p>“I can confirm that he is doing well. And this is the beginning of the next stage of his recovery,” said Dr. William Knight, one of his doctors in Cincinnati.</p><p>Doctors said Hamlin has been walking since having a breathing tube removed on Friday, eating regular food and undergoing therapy. They said he was on a normal or even accelerated trajectory in his recovery from cardiac arrest, which is considered a life-threatening event, and that normal recovery can be measured from weeks to months.</p><p>“We continue to be ecstatic about his recovery,” Dr. Timothy Pritts said.</p><p>Hamlin’s return comes a day after he cheered on the Bills from his hospital bed during their regular season-ending <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-england-patriots-buffalo-bills-miami-dolphins-york-jets-nfl-25243cdf2ceb3780419859fc39537ef4">35-23 win</a> over the New England Patriots. The game proved to be a cathartic outpouring of support for the Bills and Hamlin.</p><div id="afs:Card:234821764243" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="35005f5e4ac87eca56e7d99d49eaec65">Hub peek embed (NFL) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“Headed home to Buffalo today with a lot of love on my heart,” Hamlin said in a tweet. “Watching the world come together around me on Sunday was truly an amazing feeling.” </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Hamlin was so excited watching teammate Nyheim Hines return the opening kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown that "he jumped up and down, got out of his chair, set every alarm off in the ICU in the process," Pritts said with a laugh. “But he was fine. It was just appropriate reaction to very exciting play.”</p><p>Pritts said it was still premature to comment on the potential cause of Hamlin’s cardiac arrest and that more testing would be done.</p><p>“The goal of the transfer .... is to get him closer to home for further evaluation, recovery and eventually discharge and rehabilitation,” Buffalo General Medical Center/Gates Vascular Institute said in a news release.</p><div id="1671a3ce8f694de18a3d181c6bb9d600" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>The Bills wore No. 3 Hamlin patches on their jerseys Sunday and honored their teammate by raising three fingers in the closing minutes, while tight end Dawson Knox celebrated his touchdown by forming his hands into the shape of a heart. Fans joined in, with many holding up red heart and No. 3 signs.</p><p>“The same love you all have shown me is the same love that I plan to put back into the world n more,” Hamlin tweeted Monday.</p><p>Bills coach Sean McDermott and general manager Brandon Beane briefly saw Hamlin after he landed in Buffalo.</p><p>“We’re happy to have him back.” McDermott told reporters on a conference call. “He’s a little bit tired, but it was good to get to see him in person for the first time in a while."</p><p>The 24-year-old from the Pittsburgh area has made significant progress in his recovery since spending his first two days at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center under sedation and breathing through a ventilator.</p><p>He was awakened on Wednesday night and was eventually able to grip people’s hands. By Friday, Hamlin was able to breathe on his own and even addressed the team by videoconference, telling the Bills, “Love you boys.”</p><p>The last update from doctors came on Saturday, when they described Hamlin’s neurological function as “excellent,” though he remained listed in critical condition. </p><p>Pritts said doctors were able to upgrade his condition from critical on Monday, clearing the way for the flight home.</p><p>“We want to ensure that each organ system is stable to improving and that he needs a minimal amount of assistance such that he does not need intensive nursing,” Pritts said. “We have some awesome rock star nurses who’ve been with him from the beginning, but he no longer needs that level of nursing care and no longer needs intensive respiratory therapy from our respiratory care practitioners and is able to then move to a setting where he would have less intensive care.”</p><p>A doctor accompanied Hamlin to the airport.</p><p>Doctors declined to speculate about whether Hamlin would be able to attend a game in person. By beating New England, the Bills (13-3) clinched home-field advantage through the first two rounds of the playoffs. Buffalo is preparing to host division rival Miami in a wild-card playoff matchup on Sunday.</p><p>“Right now it's just a young man recovering from a very serious illness, and we think that he will recover well from this,” Pritts said. “He has a great positive attitude.”</p><p>Hamlin's heart stopped on Monday night after making what appeared to be a routine tackle in the first quarter against the Bengals. The game was initially suspended before officially being canceled later in the week.</p><p>News of Hamlin's discharge from the hospital in Cincinnati was greeted with enthusiasm.</p><p>"That’s unbelievable," Bengals coach Zac Taylor said.</p><p>“I mean, just think about it — that was one week, not even a week ago. There’s no one in this room that would have expected he’d be in Buffalo," he added. “God is great. He works miracles. This is certainly a miracle, there’s no question. ... And just an amazing moment for Damar.”</p><p>___</p><p>AP Sports Writer Mitch Stacy in Cincinnati contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL </p>]]></description>

(Skyler Swisher/Orlando Sentinel via AP)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) — As Brazil <a href="https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-jair-bolsonaro-politics-brazil-government-8766c0ad2fcc4ae7c8bf1aa7f9aaa0ec?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=TopNews&amp;utm_campaign=position_01">reels</a> from mobs of rioters swarming its seats of power, its former leader has decamped to a Florida resort, where droves of supporters flocked to cheer on their ousted president.</p><p>Devotees have traveled in recent days to the temporary home of Jair Bolsonaro, a gated community with towering waterslides, for a chance to see him. He signed autographs, hugged children and took selfies with adoring masses, some sporting “Make Brazil Great Again” shirts.</p><p>“I will always support him,” said 31-year-old Rafael Silva, who left Brazil eight years ago and now installs flooring in central Florida, where he stood outside Bolsonaro’s rental home Monday. “He was the best for the country.”</p><p>By early afternoon, the handful of supporters in yellow jerseys dissipated as word spread that the divisive, hard-right leader was hospitalized with abdominal pain. His wife, Michelle, said on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/michellebolsonaro/3012092944613514280/">social media</a> that he had been hospitalized for observation due to abdominal discomfort related to a 2018 stabbing that has led to multiple hospitalizations in the past. A photo <a href="https://oglobo.globo.com/blogs/lauro-jardim/post/2023/01/bolsonaro-internado-num-hospital-nos-eua.ghtml">published</a> by Brazilian newspaper O Globo showed him smiling from his hospital bed. A hospital spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a phone call and text message.</p><div id="afs:Card:272901778982" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="099db80c6511119b534ca17747f871fe">Hub peek embed (JairBolsonaro) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Prior to Sunday’s angry storming of Brazil's Congress, Supreme Court and presidential palace, Bolsonaro had been seen repeatedly in this central Florida community, wandering a Publix supermarket’s aisles, dining alone at a local KFC and, most of all, surrounded by clusters of adoring fans. </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Though the Osceola County Sheriff’s Office said it received a request from the Secret Service to provide a police escort for Bolsonaro when he arrived and he was still a sitting president, he has not been surrounded by a noticeable phalanx of security.</p><p>“He will make himself right at home in Florida’s right-wing ecosystem of grifting and podcasting, finding allies with whomever thinks they can use him to advance their far-right agenda,” said Andy Reiter, a professor of politics and international relations at Mount Holyoke College who has researched foreign strongmen.</p><p>His new home, Encore Resort at Reunion in the suburbs of Orlando, is made up of furnished rental homes with foosball tables, screening rooms, Disney decor on the walls and Mickey Mouse stuffed animals on beds.</p><p>If it all seems too odd, the sight of the former leader of one of the world’s biggest countries wandering a gated community a stone’s throw from Walt Disney World in shorts, consider the history. </p><p>A stream of regional leaders have called the state home, at least for a time, over the past half century, from Haiti’s Prosper Avril to Nicaragua’s Anastasio Somoza to Panama’s Manuel Noriega. Alongside a list of other Latin American notables, they’ve camped out in both modest homes and elaborate mansions and, in the case of Noriega, a Miami prison cell, where he served 17 years on drug charges.</p><p>When asked by reporters Monday if the U.S. would send Bolsonaro back to Brazil, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the Biden administration hadn’t received any requests from Brazil related to the former president.</p><p>Brazilian Justice Minister Flavio Dino told reporters that, as of now, Brazil had no plans to ask the U.S. for Bolsonaro to be extradited.</p><p>A bevy of Brazilians have been lured to central Florida in the past two decades and have in turn transformed the region with scores of Brazilian shops and restaurants. </p><p>Florida has the largest population of residents who were born in Brazil – nearly 130,000 people –- of any U.S. state, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Many more come as visitors, with 830,000 Brazilians traveling to central Florida in 2019, the third largest international market for the area.</p><p>Though Lula da Silva won Brazil’s election by more than 2 million votes, Brazilian voters living in Florida appear to have heavily favored Bolsonaro. Election data for Brazilians living abroad shows 56 polling locations listed under Miami, the only Florida city under which data is compiled.</p><p>In each of the 56 areas, Bolsonaro prevailed, some by margins of 6-to-1. All told, more than 16,000 votes were counted among Brazilians under the Miami umbrella, with 81% favoring Bolsonaro.</p><p>“He is very popular with the Brazilian emigres in central Florida,” said Joel Stewart, former honorary consul for Brazil in Orlando. Brazil opened a consular office in Orlando last year.</p><p>Bolsonaro has long been called the “Trump of the tropics,” so it may come as no surprise that he wound up just a few hours’ drive away from the former American president’s Palm Beach compound. Both rode to power fueled by right-wing, anti-establishment anger, pursued nationalist platforms while in office, then spread lies about voter fraud in their own defeats. Followers of both men attacked the seats of government in anger after their preferred candidate lost.</p><p>Rodrigo Constantino, a right-wing Brazilian commentator who lives in Florida, says he sees parallels between Bolsonaro’s support in the state and the reelection triumph of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. Both, he said, amounted to rejections of “the totalitarian, woke, economic egalitarianism and sensational demagogy of the radical left.”</p><p>Whatever anger might exist against Bolsonaro in Brazil, Constantino says Brazilians living in Florida will understand and accept him.</p><p>“If he wants to come to my house and eat barbecue and chat about soccer or talk bad about communism, he will be very well received,” Constantino said.</p><p>___</p><p>Sedensky reported from New York.

(Ronen Zvulun/Pool Photo via AP)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s new government has wasted no time implementing its ultra-nationalist agenda, including adopting a seemingly petty ban on displaying the Palestinian flag and shaking the foundations of Israel’s democracy with a proposed legal assault on the Supreme Court.</p><p>After barely two weeks in power, the most hard-line and religious government in Israel’s history already is fomenting divisions at home and barreling toward conflict with the Palestinians and Israel’s allies abroad.</p><p>“We are not waiting, and I think the citizens of Israel already feel this,” Netanyahu told lawmakers in his Likud Party on Monday. “We formed a different government, with different policies, and we run things differently.”</p><p>Just days after taking office, his national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, visited Jerusalem’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-jerusalem-religion-israel-government-benjamin-netanyahu-a0e43cbddec11549e60754dc8231a222">most sensitive holy site</a> — a hilltop compound revered by Jews and Muslims. While Ben-Gvir respected existing norms that bar Jewish prayer at the site, the visit was seen by many as a provocation given his past calls for giving Jewish worshippers greater access. It drew Palestinian condemnations and angry statements from the United States and Israel’s own Arab allies.</p><p>Netanyahu has also taken aim at the internationally recognized Palestinian leadership in the occupied West Bank. Palestinians successfully lobbied the U.N. General Assembly to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-israel-government-west-bank-united-nations-dff4f816f0962eeeb16527caf763a695">seek a legal opinion</a> from the International Court of Justice on Israel’s policies in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem, and the Israeli government responded with a series of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-israel-palestinian-territories-government-middle-east-f795eb80d0c96c185cd2a3c6ea81119f">punitive measures</a>.</p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="c3419b07e43f853e9a8d44d55fc4a886">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Some of the steps have hit the Palestinians hard, such as withholding some $40 million in tax revenues and instead using the money to compensate Israeli victims of Palestinian violence. There are also plans to halt development in Palestinian villages in Israeli-controlled parts of the West Bank.</p><p>Other moves have been more symbolic, such as revoking the VIP privileges of top Palestinian officials and banning displays of Palestinian flags inside Israel. Israeli authorities over the weekend even broke up a meeting of Palestinian parents discussing their children’s school conditions in east Jerusalem. Israel claimed the meeting was funded by the Palestinian Authority but provided no supporting evidence.</p><p>Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh on Monday accused Israel of trying to “topple the authority and pushing it to the brink, financially and institutionally.”</p><p>At home, Netanyahu and his allies have unveiled a sweeping plan to overhaul the country’s justice system. The centerpiece proposal would give parliament the authority <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-israel-government-benjamin-netanyahu-5b240d4bc5d2fb8f533694fc6b7b7809">to overturn Supreme Court decisions</a> with a simple majority. Critics say that would destroy Israel’s democratic system of check and balances.</p><p>Thousands of Israelis joined a demonstration over the weekend against the proposed legal overhaul, and former Supreme Court President Aharon Barak warned that the plan would turn Israel into a “hollow democracy.” Benny Gantz, a former defense minister who now sits in the opposition, warned Monday that Netanyahu was pushing the country toward “civil war.”</p><p>The Netanyahu policies are no surprise. After four inconclusive elections in just three years, Netanyahu was able to eke out a victory in a fifth round of voting by joining forces with a collection of far-right and ultra-Orthodox partners.</p><p>“We received a clear mandate from the public, to carry out what we promised in the elections. That’s what we will do,” Netanyahu said at Monday's faction meeting.</p><p>The coalition is dominated by hard-liners who detest the Palestinians, oppose the idea of peace talks and reject the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-elections-israel-benjamin-netanyahu-tel-aviv-65155b743a5a8e73eb4b4f50eff9229a">Ben-Gvir</a>, for instance, is a follower of a deceased radical rabbi who advocated mass expulsions of Palestinians from the country.</p><p>Convicted over a decade ago on incitement and domestic terrorism charges, Ben-Gvir is now a senior Cabinet minister overseeing the national police force. His partner, the hard-liner <a href="https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-religion-israel-west-bank-12ef4696a2ef2e6ca3a6a75ce3e114c0">Bezalel Smotrich</a>, is a settler leader who has been placed in charge of West Bank settlement construction.</p><p>Netanyahu, who is on trial for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-israel-benjamin-netanyahu-7d28197c9032d98d04a8951f3adc98fb">corruption charges</a>, was willing to turn over authority to his partners because they share his animosity toward a legal system they believe is elitist and hostile. It is widely believed that the legal overhaul, spearheaded by Justice Minister Yariv Levin, a close confidant of Netanyahu, will eventually lead to dismissal of the charges against the prime minister.</p><p>“This is the most extreme government that Israel has ever had,” said Nadav Eyal, an Israeli commentator and author of “Revolt,” a book about the rise of populism and nationalism worldwide. “What we’re seeing right now is a manifestation of their views, and they are basically doing what they promised.”</p><p>“To a large extent, the international community and many Israelis did not understand that they intend to actually implement much of their portfolio, and they don’t have anything to counter them politically,” he added.</p><p>Nahum Barnea, a veteran columnist at the Yediot Ahronot daily newspaper, said Netanyahu appears to be “testing the waters” by allowing his partners to promote their hard-line policies while he tries to deflect international criticism.</p><p>But he said Netanyahu will face problems reining in his coalition partners “because he doesn’t have partners for a more moderate policy.”</p><p>He said Netanyahu has no interest in picking a fight with the Biden administration. “But Netanyahu is no dictator. He has to take into consideration these very strong voices.”</p><p>Levin said last week that his plans to weaken the Supreme Court are just a first stage of action. The government’s published guidelines call for more West Bank settlement construction, the legalization of dozens of illegally built outposts and eventually the full annexation of the territory.</p><p>Such proposals will almost guarantee a showdown with the U.S., the Palestinians and the broader international community. The West Bank already is in the midst of its deadliest burst of violence in nearly two decades.</p><p>So far, the Biden administration has issued a series of cautious statements stressing the deep ties with Israel while reiterating the U.S. commitment to a two-state solution.</p><p>The tone could sharpen when top officials — including national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken — visit in the coming weeks.</p><p>Israel’s new Arab allies in the Persian Gulf, particularly the United Arab Emirates, could also play a key role. The 2020 Abraham Accords between Israel and four Arab countries are among Netanyahu’s proudest accomplishments, and he has said he hopes to add regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia to the list.</p><p>The UAE criticized Ben-Gvir’s visit to the Jerusalem holy site, and according to Israeli media reports, delayed Netanyahu's plan to visit.</p><p>But any damage to relations was minor. The UAE is hosting Arab and Israeli and American diplomats this week ahead of a major regional summit expected this spring.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) — As another powerful storm walloped California, a 5-year-old boy was swept away by floodwaters Monday on the state’s central coast and an entire seaside community that is home to Prince Harry, Oprah Winfrey and other celebrities was ordered to evacuate on the fifth anniversary of deadly mudslides there.</p><p>Tens of thousands of people remained without power, and some schools closed for the day. Streets and highways transformed into gushing rivers, trees toppled, mud slid and motorists growled as they hit roadblocks caused by fallen debris. The death toll from the relentless string of storms climbed from 12 to 14 on Monday, after two people were killed by falling trees, state officials said.</p><p>A roughly seven-hour search for the missing boy turned up only his shoe before officials called it off as water levels were too dangerous for divers, officials said. The boy has not been declared dead, said spokesperson Tony Cipolla of the San Luis Obispo County Sheriff’s Office. </p><p>The boy’s mother was driving a truck when it became stranded in floodwaters just before 8 a.m. near Paso Robles, a small city inland from California's central coast, according to Tom Swanson, assistant chief of the Cal Fire/San Luis Obispo County Fire Department.</p><p>Bystanders were able to pull the mother out of the truck, but the boy was swept out of the vehicle and downstream, likely into a river, Swanson said. There was no evacuation order in the area at the time. </p><p>About 130 miles (209 kilometers) to the south, the entire community of Montecito and surrounding canyons scarred by recent wildfires were under an evacuation order that came on the <a href="https://apnews.com/60bdabd547a540b0b72da785739a9033/8-dead-in-Southern-California-as-rain-triggers-mudslides">fifth anniversary of a mudslide</a> that killed 23 people and destroyed more than 100 homes in the coastal enclave. </p><p>In Los Angeles, a sinkhole swallowed two cars in the Chatsworth area on Monday night. Two people escaped by themselves and firefighters using ropes and an aerial ladder rescued two others who had minor injuries, authorities said.</p><p>The National Weather Service reported rainfall rates of one inch (2.5 centimeters) per hour, with heavy downpours expected throughout the night in the upscale area where roads wind along wooded hillsides studded with large houses. Montecito is squeezed between mountains and the Pacific and is home to celebrities including Rob Lowe and Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. </p><p>Ellen DeGeneres shared an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CnNnn09hYD4/">Instagram video</a> of herself standing in front of a raging creek near the Montecito home where she lives with her wife, actor Portia de Rossi. She said in the post that they were told to shelter in place because they are on high ground.</p><p>“This is crazy!” the talk show host, wearing a hoodie and raincoat, says in the video. “This creek next to our house never flows, ever. It’s probably about nine feet up and is going to go another two feet up."</p><p>Jamie McLeod's property was under the Montecito evacuation order, but she said there is no way for her to “get off the mountain” with a rushing creek on one side and a mudslide on the other. The 60-year-old owner of the Santa Barbara Bird Sanctuary said one of her employees came to make a weekly food delivery and is stuck, too.</p><p>McLeod said she feels fortunate because her home sits on high ground and the power is still on. But she said she tires of the frequent evacuation orders since the massive wildfire followed by the deadly landslide five years ago.</p><p>“It is not easy to relocate,” said McLeod. “I totally love it — except in catastrophe.”</p><p>Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said the decision to evacuate nearly 10,000 people was “based on the continuing high rate of rainfall with no indication that that is going to change before nightfall.” Creeks were overflowing, and many roads were flooded. </p><p>Northbound lanes of U.S. 101, a key coastal route, were expected to be shut until Tuesday. Many other highways and local roads were closed because of rockslides and flooding.</p><p>Up the coast, evacuation orders were issued in Santa Cruz County for about 32,000 residents living near rain-swollen rivers and creeks. The San Lorenzo River was declared at flood stage, and drone footage showed numerous homes sitting in muddy brown water, the top halves of autos peeking out. </p><p>Maria Cucchiara, who lives in tiny, flooded Felton, went for a walk to count her blessings after “a huge branch harpooned” the roof of her small studio, she said. </p><p>"I have two kitties, and we could’ve been killed. It was over a ton," she said. "So needless to say, it was very disturbing.”</p><p>Nicole Martin, owner of the Fern River Resort in Felton, described a more laid-back scene Monday. Her clients sipped coffee amid towering redwood trees and were "enjoying the show,” she said, as picnic tables and other debris floated down the swollen San Lorenzo. </p><p>The river is usually about 60 feet (18 meters) below the cabins, Martin said, but it crept up to 12 feet (4 meters) from the cabins. </p><p>In Northern California, several districts closed schools and more than 35,000 customers remained without power in Sacramento — down from more than 350,000 a day earlier after gusts of 60 mph (97 kph) knocked majestic trees into power lines, according to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District. A homeless person killed by a falling tree in the region was among the new deaths announced Monday.</p><p>The National Weather Service warned of a “relentless parade of atmospheric rivers” — long plumes of moisture stretching out into the Pacific that can drop staggering amounts of rain and snow. The precipitation expected over the next couple of days comes after storms last week knocked out power, flooded streets, and battered the coastline.</p><p>President Joe Biden issued an emergency declaration Monday to support storm response and relief efforts in more than a dozen counties.</p><p>The weather service issued a flood watch for a large portion of Northern and Central California, with 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 centimeters) of rain expected through Wednesday in the already saturated Sacramento-area foothills. </p><p>In the Los Angeles area, there was potential for as much as 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain in foothill areas late Monday and Tuesday. High surf was also expected. </p><p>Much of California remains in severe to extreme drought, though the storms have helped fill depleted reservoirs.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press journalists Janie Har and Olga R. Rodriguez in San Francisco, Amy Taxin in Orange County, Andrew Dalton in Los Angeles, Nic Coury in Aptos, Martha Mendoza in Santa Cruz and Haven Daley in Felton contributed to this report. </p>]]></description>

The lengthy investigation has been one of several around the country that threaten legal peril for Trump as he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-2024-updates-cd5339d48064a149527e8f9a1aa7614e">mounts a third bid for the White House</a>.</p><p>The decision whether to seek an indictment from a regular grand jury will be up to Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. Willis spokesperson Jeff DiSantis said the office had no comment on the completion of the panel's work.</p><p>McBurney wrote in his order that the special grand jury recommended that its report be made public. He scheduled a hearing for Jan. 24 to determine whether all or part of the report should be released and said the district attorney’s office and news outlets would be given an opportunity to make arguments at that hearing.</p><p>Since June, the special grand jury has heard testimony from dozens of witnesses, including numerous close Trump associates such as the former New York mayor and Trump attorney <a href="https://apnews.com/article/rudy-giuliani-testimony-georgia-election-investigation-e9be9d1c149214b8a386d1621e2c3dfb">Rudy Giuliani and</a><a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-georgia-atlanta-88095d01932c62ee4a6dc2db1786ada9">Sen.

Brian Kemp and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-georgia-atlanta-presidential-3bc4ae72555ee3f22a13554d9b27d240">Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger</a>. </p><p>Last month, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection <a href="https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-donald-trump-2b406a42f8be60fb46443495b08ae0cb">asserted in its final report</a> that Trump criminally engaged in a “multi-part conspiracy” to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election and failed to act to stop his supporters from attacking the Capitol. The report concluded an extraordinary 18-month investigation into the former president and the violent attack.</p><p>Special grand juries in Georgia cannot issue indictments but instead can issue a final report recommending actions to be taken. </p><p>Willis opened the investigation in early 2021, shortly after a recording surfaced of a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-georgia-elections-a7b4aa4d8ce3bf52301ddbe620c6bff6">Jan. 2, 2021, phone call</a> between Trump and Raffensperger.

The rocket was supposed to take nine small satellites for mixed civil and defense use into orbit. </p><p>But about two hours after the plane took off, the company reported that the mission encountered a problem.</p><p>“We appear to have an anomaly that has prevented us from reaching orbit. We are evaluating the information,” Virgin Orbit said on Twitter. </p><p>Virgin Orbit, which is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange, was founded by British billionaire Richard Branson. It has previously completed four similar launches from California.</p><p>Hundreds gathered for the launch cheered earlier as a repurposed Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747 aircraft, named “Cosmic Girl,” took off from Cornwall late Monday. Around an hour into the flight, the plane released the rocket at around 35,000 feet (around 10,000 meters) over the Atlantic Ocean to the south of Ireland. </p><p>The plane, piloted by a Royal Air Force pilot, returned to Cornwall after releasing the rocket.</p><div id="afs:Card:926746779134" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="b17357dddb4bb75fd13a088534a4c5a2">Hub peek embed (apf-science) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Some of the satellites are meant for U.K. defense monitoring, while others are for businesses such as those working in navigational technology.

Ian Annett, deputy chief executive at the U.K. Space Agency, said Monday it marked a “new era” for his country's space industry. There was strong market demand for small satellite launches, Annett said, and the U.K. has ambitions to be ”the hub of European launches." </p><p>In the past, satellites produced in the U.K. had to be sent to spaceports in other countries to make their journey into space.</p><p>The mission was a collaboration between the U.K. Space Agency, the Royal Air Force, Virgin Orbit and Cornwall Council. </p><p>The launch was originally planned for late last year, but it was postponed because of technical and regulatory issues.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>LONDON (AP) — <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/prince-harry">Prince Harry</a> has accused his stepmother, Camilla, the queen consort, of leaking private conversations to the media to burnish her own reputation as he promotes a new book that lays bare his story of his life behind palace walls.</p><p>In interviews broadcast Sunday and Monday, Harry accused members of the royal family of getting “into bed with the devil” to gain favorable tabloid coverage, singling out Camilla’s efforts to rehabilitate her image with the British people after her longtime affair with his father, now King Charles III.</p><p>“That made her dangerous because of the connections that she was forging within the British press,” he told CBS. “There was open willingness on both sides to trade information. And with a family built on hierarchy, and with her on the way to being queen consort, there was gonna be people or bodies left in the street.”</p><div id="afs:Card:611836720368" content-id="4141be64bcd1521d1d5cf0f9b65e20b5" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (PrinceHarry) - Compressed layout </div><p>Harry spoke to Britain’s ITV, CBS’s “60 Minutes” and “Good Morning America″ to promote his book “Spare,” which is to be widely released Tuesday. Some U.K. bookshops opened at midnight to meet demand <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-united-kingdom-prince-harry-books-and-literature-nonfiction-7082bf624e4b43826d0cc39ce69f961f">for the highly anticipated memoir,</a> which has generated <a href="https://apnews.com/article/queen-elizabeth-ii-king-charles-iii-politics-united-kingdom-prince-harry-952c0cbaa0c39d18b8338ca651b49394">incendiary headlines</a> with reports that it includes details of bitter family resentments, as well as Harry and his wife Meghan’s decision to give up their royal roles and move to California.</p><p>“I want to be able to paint the picture myself, see it for myself, and then be able to say, okay, yes, maybe things have changed or maybe the person has matured," said Chris Imfidon, chair of the charity Excellence in Education. He traveled from Essex to London to buy three copies of “Spare,” wanting to compare the media picture of Harry to what's in the book. "If I just read in the newspaper, I don’t think I’ll be satisfied just hearing because each newspaper gives it totally different picture of the duke, he said.</p><p>In the interviews, Harry repeatedly blamed the media for the troubles that afflicted the couple, also known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, saying the coverage contributed to the rift with his brother, Prince William, and his wife, Kate.</p><p>“They always pitched us against each other,″ he told Good Morning America. “They pitch Kate and Meghan against each other.”</p><p>Harry was also unapologetic about launching legal battles against some parts of the British media. While he said his father believes it is “probably a suicide mission” to take on the press, Harry described changing the media landscape in the UK as being “my life’s work.”</p><p>But Harry also continued to criticize the royal family itself.</p><p>He repeated his claim that there was “concern” in the royal family about his unborn child’s skin color after he married biracial American actress Meghan Markle. Harry and Meghan first mentioned the incident during an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021, but they haven’t identified the family member who expressed concern.</p><p>Harry insisted his family wasn’t racist, but said the episode was an example of unconscious bias. The prince told CBS that he was “probably bigoted” before he met Meghan, and said that the royal family, which is held to a higher moral standard, needed to “learn and grow” in order to be “part of the solution rather than part of the problem.”</p><p>“Otherwise unconscious bias then moves into the category of racism,” Harry told ITV. </p><p>“Spare” explores Harry’s grief over the death of his mother in 1997, and his long-simmering resentment at his role as the royal “spare,” overshadowed by the “heir” — older brother William. He recounts arguments and a physical altercation with William, reveals how he lost his virginity and describes using cocaine and cannabis.</p><p>He also says <a href="https://apnews.com/article/prince-harry-afghanistan-service-claims-1c497d35a8211dc0366429856a539e2a">he killed 25 Taliban fighters</a> while serving as an Apache helicopter pilot <a href="https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-nato-politics-taliban-prince-harry-603f12d84207e994dc16e556a556960d">in Afghanistan</a> — drawing criticism from both the Taliban and British military veterans.</p><p>The allegations about Camilla are particularly sensitive because of her role in the acrimonious breakdown of Charles’ marriage to the late Princess Diana, William and Harry’s mother. </p><p>Diana once described Camilla, who carried out a long-term affair with Charles, as the third person in their marriage. While many members of the public initially shunned Camilla, she has won fans by taking on a wide range of charitable activities and has been credited with helping Charles appear less stuffy and more in tune with modern Britain. </p><p>Writing about his father’s 2005 wedding to Camilla, Harry says: “I had complex feelings about gaining a stepparent who, I believed, had recently sacrificed me on her personal PR altar.” Still, he says he wanted his father to be happy. “In a funny way I even wanted Camilla to be happy. Maybe she’d be less dangerous if she was happy?”</p><p>“Spare” is the latest in a string of public pronouncements by Harry and Meghan since they quit royal life and moved to California in 2020, citing what they saw as the media’s racist treatment of Meghan and a lack of support from the palace. It follows the interview with Winfrey and a six-part Netflix series released last month.</p><p>In the ghostwritten memoir, Harry, 38, describes the couple’s acrimonious split from the royal family after their request for a part-time royal role was rejected. </p><p>The television interviews are certain to pile more pressure on the royal family. Harry is also appearing on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”</p><p>Royal officials haven’t commented on any of the allegations, though allies have pushed back on the claims, largely anonymously.</p><p>Harry has defended the memoir describing it as his effort to “own my story” after years of “spin and distortion” by others. In the “60 Minutes” interview, Harry denied his book was intended to hurt his family. </p><p>Omid Scobie, co-author of “Finding Freedom,” a book on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, said Harry is offering the look behind the palace walls that the public has always wanted.</p><p>“Of course, that does come with some downsides for those who have been part of his journey,″ Scobie told the BBC. “We heard some sort of really startling confessions and stories about members of the royal family, particularly when it comes to Camilla and her relationship with the press.’’</p><p>While Harry <a href="https://apnews.com/article/prince-harry-memoir-royal-family-cac109c42b6e1e5d0298e9a5a146ae2e">said he hadn’t spoken with his father or brother in a while,</a> he hopes to find peace with them. But he told ITV that the “the ball is in their court.”</p><p>“They’ve shown absolutely no willingness to reconcile,” he said.</p><p>While the saga is damaging to the royal family, it may not be as harmful as people might think and will give the global audience a forum to discuss difficult issues like misogyny and racism, said Boston University professor Arianne Chernock, an expert in modern British history. </p><p>But she was cautious about doomsayers suggesting the monarchy itself was in trouble. The institution has endured more than 1,000 years after all. </p><p>“This is a central component of the history of the royal family,’’ she said. “Scandal is the norm not the exception.’’</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press Writers Jill Lawless and Kwiyeon Ha contributed.</p>]]></description>

(Jan. 9)</p>    <p>MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican President Andres Manuel López Obrador challenged U.S. President Joe Biden to end an attitude of “abandonment” and “disdain” for Latin America and the Caribbean as the two leaders met on Monday, making for a brusque opening to a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-mexico-government-us-national-security-council-united-states-599d640834d079503c5dd568c312c19f">summit of North American leaders</a>.</p><p>The comments were a stark contrast to the public display of affection between López Obrador and Biden shortly before, as they smiled and embraced and shook hands for the cameras. But once the two sat down in an ornate room at the Palacio Nacional, flanked by delegations of top officials, it didn't take long for tensions to bubble to the surface. </p><p>Most of the summit’s work will be handled on Tuesday, when the two leaders and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau are to hold hours of talks. Migration, both legal and illegal, and border security will be key topics.</p><p>On Monday, López Obrador challenged Biden to improve life across the region, telling him that “you hold the key in your hand.”</p><p>“This is the moment for us to determine to do away with this abandonment, this disdain, and this forgetfulness for Latin America and the Caribbean,” he said.</p><p>He also complained that too many imports are coming from Asia instead of being produced in the Americas. </p><div id="afs:Card:130243251955" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="871328ff21fc6a87b698742f6e9ed3d4">Hub peek embed (JoeBiden) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“We ask ourselves, couldn’t we produce in America what we consume?" he said. "Of course.”</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Biden responded by defending the billions of dollars that the United States spends in foreign aid around the world, saying “unfortunately our responsibility just doesn't end in the Western Hemisphere.” And he referenced U.S. deaths from fentanyl, a drug that flows over the border from Mexico. </p><p>While both men pledged to work together, it was a noticeably sharp exchange, on full display before reporters. They met privately for about an hour before having dinner with Trudeau and their wives.</p><p>The meeting is held most years, although there was a hiatus while Donald Trump was U.S. president. It’s often called the “three amigos summit,” a reference to the deep diplomatic and economic ties between the countries, but new strains have emerged. </p><p>All three countries are struggling to handle an influx of people arriving in North America and to crack down on smugglers who profit from persuading migrants to make the dangerous trip to the U.S. </p><div id="063aa670ed3040f686f8a53725ad8166" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>In addition, Canada and the U.S. accuse López Obrador of violating a free trade pact by favoring Mexico’s state-owed utility over power plants built by foreign and private investors. Meanwhile, Trudeau and López Obrador are concerned about Biden’s efforts to boost domestic manufacturing, creating concerns that U.S. neighbors could be left behind.</p><p>Biden and López Obrador haven’t been on particularly good terms for the past two years either. The Mexican leader made no secret of his admiration for Trump, and last year <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-covid-politics-health-6efb4c2bde5d080a9ee400a0981f7a61">he skipped a Los Angeles summit</a> because Biden didn’t invite the authoritarian regimes of Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. </p><p>However, there have been attempts made at thawing the relationship. Biden made a point of flying into <a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-technology-travel-business-health-c3e5a593e5f99167b94f8b037b7cc60c">the new Felipe Angeles International Airport</a>, a prized project of the Mexican president even though it’s been a source of controversy.</p><p>The airport, which is expected to cost $4.1 billion when finished, is more than an hour’s drive north of the city center, has few flights and until recently lacked consistent drinking water. However, it’s one of the keystone projects that López Obrador is racing to finish before his term ends next year, along with an oil refinery, a tourist train in the Yucatan Peninsula and a train linking Gulf coast and Pacific seaports.</p><p>The two leaders rode into Mexico City in Biden’s limousine. López Obrador was fascinated by the presidential vehicle known as “the beast,” and he said Biden “showed me how the buttons work.”</p><p>In a notably warm comment, the Mexican president described the two leaders’ first encounter of the trip as “very pleasant,” and he said “President Biden is a friendly person.”</p><p>The U.S. and Mexico have also reached an agreement on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-mexico-immigration-af0643a4fb8f45388fe247e44c9b2c5e">a major shift in migration policy</a>, which Biden announced last week. </p><p>Under the plan, the U.S. will send 30,000 migrants per month from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela back across the border from among those who entered the U.S. illegally. Migrants who arrive from those four countries are not easily returned to their home countries for a variety of reasons.</p><p>In addition, 30,000 people per month from those four nations <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-venezuela-mexico-spokane-violence-0eb316a474baed22f433359b0644320b">who get sponsors</a>, background checks and an airline flight to the U.S. will get the ability to work legally in the country for two years. </p><p>On Monday, before the summit began, López Obrador said he would consider accepting more migrants than previously announced. </p><p>“We don’t want to anticipate things, but this is part of what we are going to talk about at the summit,” López Obrador said. “We support this type of measures, to give people options, alternatives,” he said, adding that “the numbers may be increased.”</p><p>Mexico would likely also require an increase in those receiving work authorization in the U.S. in order to take back more migrants who are being expelled. </p><p>Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, cautioned that nothing was decided yet.</p><p>“What we need is to see how the program announced last week works in practice, what if any adjustments need to be made to that program and then we can talk about taking the next steps,” he said. </p><p>On his way to Mexico, Biden stopped in El Paso, Texas, for four hours — <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-united-states-government-mexico-el-paso-2e30ea26bbc55c7af509a6e60ad3d33c">his first time at the border as president</a> and the longest he’s spent along the U.S-Mexico line. The visit was highly controlled and seemed designed to counter Republican claims of a crisis situation by showcasing a smooth operation to process migrants entering legally, weed out smuggled contraband and humanely treat those who’ve entered illegally. </p><p>But the trip was likely to do little to quell critics from both sides, including immigrant advocates who accuse the Democratic president of establishing cruel policies not unlike those of his hardline predecessor, Republican Donald Trump.</p><p>The number of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border has risen dramatically during Biden’s first two years in office. There were more than 2.38 million stops during the year that ended Sept. 30, the first time the number topped 2 million. </p><p>On Monday afternoon, López Obrador formally welcomed Biden at the Palacio Nacional, the first time since 2014 that Mexico has hosted a U.S. president.</p><p>In a display of solidarity, the first ladies of the U.S. and Mexico delivered the same speech, alternating between Jill Biden in English and Beatriz Gutiérrez Müller in Spanish.</p><p>“We believe that poverty is not destined by God, but the product of inequality,” Jill Biden said. “We know that the poor deserve to live better and are working with compassion, every day, to improve lives for everyone.”</p><p>Earlier in the day, Jill Biden met with women from the fields of education, art and business, most of them recipients of U.S. cooperation programs or scholarships.</p><p>“Do whatever you want but teach others,” she said.</p><p>Biden is expected to follow up his first trip to Mexico as president with another to Canada, although it has not yet been scheduled.</p><p>A senior Canadian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said Canada is working with Americans on a visit in the near future. </p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Andres Leighton in El Paso, Texas; Anita Snow in Phoenix; Morgan Lee in Santa Fe, New Mexico; Mark Stevenson and Christopher Sherman in Mexico City; Rob Gillies in Toronto and Chris Megerian and Josh Boak in Washington contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

(Jan. 9) (AP Video: Ted Shaffrey)</p>    <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Thousands of nurses went on strike Monday at two of New York City's major hospitals after contract negotiations stalled over staffing and salaries nearly three years into the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>The privately owned, nonprofit hospitals were <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-new-york-city-manhattan-business-covid-aa271a346234a352bba7abe67638b55b">postponing nonemergency surgeries, diverting ambulances to other medical centers, pulling in temporary staffers,</a> and assigning administrators with nursing backgrounds to work in wards in order to cope with the walkout. </p><p>As many as 3,500 nurses at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx and about 3,600 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan were off the job. Talks were resuming Monday afternoon at Montefiore, but there was no immediate word on when bargaining might resume at Mount Sinai.</p><p>Hundreds of nurses picketed, some singing the chorus from Twisted Sister’s 1984 hit “We’re Not Gonna Take It,” outside Mount Sinai. It was one of many New York hospitals deluged with COVID-19 patients as the virus made the city an epicenter of deaths in spring 2020.</p><p>“We were heroes only two years ago,” said Warren Urquhart, a nurse in transplant and oncology units. “We was on the front lines of the city when everything came to a stop. And now we need to come to a stop so they can understand how much we mean to this hospital and to the patients.”</p><div id="afs:Card:029281580227" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="d81f32cb7ac709404eb795a6d8822b34">Hub peek embed (apf-Health) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>The nurses union, the New York State Nurses Association, said members had to strike because chronic understaffing leaves them caring for too many patients.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Jed Basubas said he generally attends to eight to 10 patients at a time, twice the ideal number in the units where he works. Nurse practitioner Juliet Escalon said she sometimes skips bathroom breaks to attend to patients. So does Ashleigh Woodside, who said her 12-hour operating-room shifts often stretch to 14 hours because short staffing forces her and others to work overtime. </p><p>“We love our job. We want to take care of our patients. But we just want to do it safely and in a humane way, where we feel appreciated,” Woodside said.</p><p>The hospitals said they had offered the same raises — totaling 19% over three years — that the union had accepted at several other <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-manhattan-new-york-city-business-cbd1b3f34d760e016020f316cb0c9d82">facilities where contract talks reached tentative agreements</a> in recent days. </p><div id="8fbb22cafdb64680ad0b4328aba481ca" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Montefiore said it had agreed to add 170 more nurses. Mount Sinai’s administration said the union’s focus on nurse-to-patient ratios “ignores the progress we have made to attract and hire more new nurses, despite a global shortage of healthcare workers that is impacting hospitals across the country.”</p><p>The hospitals said Monday that they had prepared for the strike and were working to minimize the disruption. Mount Sinai called the union's behavior “reckless,” while Montefiore said the strike was sparking “fear and uncertainty across our community." </p><p>“In my opinion, this action was totally unnecessary,” Montefiore President Dr. Philip Ozuah told staffers in a memo Monday afternoon. Ozuah maintained that the two sides had been close to agreement on “a very generous offer.”</p><p>Some patients, meanwhile, were left in limbo. </p><p>Darcy Gervasio took medical leave from her job at a suburban college library, made child care and transportation arrangements, got tests and otherwise prepared for a gastrointestinal surgery that was scheduled Monday but now is postponed indefinitely, she said. While the procedure is considered elective, Gervasio said it's essential to controlling her Crohn’s disease.</p><p>“As a patient, of course, I am annoyed and inconvenienced," she wrote in an email. But Gervasio, a union member herself, said she blames the hospital management, not the nurses. </p><p>“I am very disappointed in the administration for letting the nursing staffing crisis get out of hand in the first place — especially in the wake of the tremendous strain on nurses during the COVID pandemic,” Gervasio wrote. She questioned why Mount Sinai couldn't strike a deal with the union when <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-new-york-city-richmond-access-to-care-business-2efedb700fbecbf1fd6871e7e33425c9">several other local hospitals did</a> in the last two weeks. </p><p>Gov. Kathy Hochul urged the union and the hospitals late Sunday <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-new-york-city-manhattan-strikes-fe2c6865b75099b70949e28f28ccf8e1">to take their dispute to binding arbitration</a>. Montefiore’s administration had said it was willing to let an arbitrator settle the contract; the union did not immediately accept the proposal. In a statement, it said Hochul, a Democrat, “should listen to the frontline COVID nurse heroes and respect our federally-protected labor and collective bargaining rights.”</p><p>A lineup of other city and state Democratic politicians, including Attorney General Letitia James, joined a midday union rally Monday. </p><p>Both hospitals had prepared for the walkout by transferring patients, including intensive-care newborns at Mount Sinai. State Health Department representatives were at the two medical centers Monday to monitor staffing levels, the agency said.</p><p>Montefiore and Mount Sinai are the last of a group of hospitals with nursing contracts that expired simultaneously. The union <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-new-york-city-richmond-strikes-8fbaff93b417ab65abb6fa0bbb2d4217">initially warned that it would strike at all</a> of them at the same time, but the other hospitals reached agreements as the deadline approached. All include raises of 7%, 6%, and 5% over the next three years.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Karen Matthews contributed to this report. </p>]]></description>

(Jan. 9) (AP video/Eduardo François)</p>    <p>RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Brazilian authorities said Monday that they were looking into who may have been behind the shocking uprising that sent protesters storming into the nation’s halls of power in a riot that had striking similarities to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.</p><p>In an unprecedented display for Latin America's largest nation, thousands of supporters of ex-President Jair Bolsonaro swarmed into Congress, the Supreme Court and the presidential palace on Sunday. Many of them said they wanted the Brazilian army to restore the far-right Bolsonaro to power and oust the newly inaugurated leftist president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.</p><p>Also on Monday, police broke down a pro-Bolsonaro encampment outside a military building and detained some 1,200 people there, the justice ministry’s press office told The Associated Press. The federal police press office said the force already plans to indict roughly 1,000 people.</p><p>Lula and the heads of the Supreme Court, Senate and Lower House signed a letter that denounced the attack and said were taking legal measures.</p><p>Justice Minister Flávio Dino told reporters that police have begun tracking those who paid for the buses that transported protesters to the capital. Speaking Monday at a news conference, he said rioters apparently intended for their displays to create a domino effect nationwide, and that they could be charged with a range of offenses, including organized crime, staging a coup and violent abolition of the democratic rule of law.</p><p>“We think that the worst is over," Dino said, adding that the government is now focused on punishing lawbreakers and those who enabled them. “We cannot and will not compromise in fulfilling our legal duties, because this fulfillment is essential so such events do not repeat themselves.”</p><p>Rioters wearing the green and yellow of the national flag broke windows, toppled furniture and hurled computers and printers to the ground. They punched holes in a massive Emiliano Di Cavalcanti painting at the presidential palace and destroyed other works of art. They overturned the U-shaped table where Supreme Court justices convene, ripped a door off one justice's office and vandalized a statue outside the court. The buildings' interiors were left in ruins.</p><p>Monday's detainments came in addition to the 300 people who were arrested Sunday during the riot.</p><p>Police were noticeably slow to react — even after the arrival of more than 100 buses — leading many to question whether authorities had either simply ignored numerous warnings, underestimated the protesters' strength or been somehow complicit.</p><p>Prosecutors in the capital said local security forces were negligent at the very least. A supreme court justice temporarily suspended the regional governor. Another justice blamed authorities for not swiftly cracking down on budding neofascism in Brazil.</p><p>After his Oct. 30 electoral defeat, Bolsonaro, who has gone to Florida, has been stoking belief among his hardcore supporters that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-caribbean-brazil-b7c872b541371ff2925fae793007af87">the nation's electronic voting system was prone to fraud,</a> though he never presented any evidence. His lawmaker son Eduardo Bolsonaro held several meetings with former U.S. President Donald Trump, Trump's longtime ally Steve Bannon and his senior campaign adviser, Jason Miller.</p><p>By early afternoon Monday, the remaining Bolsonaro supporters dissipated as word spread that he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-florida-state-government-brazil-099db80c6511119b534ca17747f871fe">was hospitalized in Florida with abdominal pain</a>. His condition wasn’t clear, but a photo published by Brazilian newspaper O Globo showed him smiling from a hospital bed. He has been hospitalized multiple times since surviving a stabbing in 2018. A hospital spokesperson did not immediately respond to a phone call and text message.</p><p>In a joint statement issued from Mexico City, U.S. President Joe Biden, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned the attack "on Brazil’s democracy and on the peaceful transfer of power.”</p><p>Results from Brazil's election — the closest in over three decades — were quickly recognized by politicians across the spectrum, including some Bolsonaro allies, as well as dozens of governments. And Bolsonaro surprised nearly everyone by promptly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-caribbean-rio-de-janeiro-e4328ee88323100cdaa1e4e461006cce">fading from view</a>. He neither conceded defeat nor emphatically cried fraud, though he and his party submitted a request to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-caribbean-brazil-c03ec4f0e1d65fc81c02a2d90181cf48">nullify millions of votes</a> that was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-caribbean-brazil-90bf6942d59fde9707c2f7b7e6bd72c4">swiftly dismissed.</a></p><p>Since 1996, Brazilians have used an electronic voting system that security experts consider less secure than hand-marked paper ballots because the system leaves no auditable paper trail. But Brazil’s system is closely scrutinized, and domestic authorities and international observers have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-caribbean-voting-donald-trump-elections-fb592d5165e5bb07c0426199d86b5787">never found evidence of it being exploited to commit fraud.</a></p><p>Still, Bolsonaro's supporters refused to accept the results. They blocked roads and remained camped outside military buildings, urging the armed forces to intervene.</p><p>Dino, the justice minister, referred to the encampments as incubators of terrorism. Protests were overwhelmingly peaceful, but <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jair-bolsonaro-caribbean-rio-de-janeiro-e4328ee88323100cdaa1e4e461006cce">isolated threats</a> — including a bomb found on a fuel truck headed to Brasilia’s airport — prompted security concerns.</p><p>Two days before Lula's Jan. 1 inauguration, Bolsonaro flew to the U.S. and took up temporary residence in Orlando. Many Brazilians expressed relief that, while he declined to participate in the transition of power, his absence allowed it to occur without incident. </p><p>Or so it had been, until Sunday's havoc. </p><p>Analysts told the AP that the upheaval could yield greater political support for Lula and his stated mission to pacify the polarized country. Many right-wing citizens and politicians were repulsed by Sunday's scenes and eager to distance themselves from far-right radicalism. The leader of Bolsonaro's own party called the uprising “an embarrassment.”</p><p>“This may have been the beginning of the end. The political system will want to isolate that radical movement and move away from it,” said Mario Sérgio Lima, political analyst at Medley Advisors. “I think what we will see now is the right trying to create new alternatives and new leaders, and the center distancing itself.”</p><p>In a news conference from Sao Paulo state, Lula read a freshly signed decree for the federal government to assume control of security in the federal district. He said that the so-called “fascist fanatics,” as well as those who financed their activities, must be punished. He also accused Bolsonaro of encouraging the uprising.</p><p>Bolsonaro repudiated the president's accusation late Sunday. Writing on Twitter, he said peaceful protest is part of democracy, but vandalism and invasion of public buildings are “exceptions to the rule.”</p><p>Unlike the 2021 attack in the U.S., few officials would have been working in the top government buildings on a Sunday. And videos showed limited presence of the capital’s military police.</p><p>One video showed a group of protesters easily pushing through a police barricade, with only a few officers using pepper spray. Another showed officers standing by as protesters stormed the Congress, including one using his phone to record what was happening.</p><p>“This was a gross error by the federal district's government,” said Thiago de Aragão, director of strategy at Brasilia-based politican consultancy Arko Advice. “Everyone knew they (the protesters) were coming to Brasilia. The expectation was that the federal district's government was going to mount a response to protect the capital. They didn't do any of that."</p><p>Lula said at his news conference that there was “incompetence or bad faith" on the part of police, and he promised that some would be punished.</p><p>Federal District Gov. Ibaneis Rocha confirmed on Twitter that he had fired the capital city’s head of public security, Anderson Torres, hours before a Supreme Court justice suspended the governor from office, alleging “intentional omission.”</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press Writer Carla Bridi contributed from Salvador.</p>]]></description>

(Novo Nordisk via AP)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>Children struggling with obesity should be evaluated and treated early and aggressively, including with medications for kids as young as 12 and surgery for those as young as 13, according to new guidelines released Monday.</p><p>The longstanding practice of “watchful waiting," or delaying treatment to see whether children and teens outgrow or overcome obesity on their own only worsens the problem that affects more than 14.4 million young people in the U.S. Left untreated, obesity can lead to lifelong health problems, including high blood pressure, diabetes and depression. </p><p>"Waiting doesn’t work,” said Dr. Ihuoma Eneli, co-author of the first <a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2022-060640/190443/Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-the-Evaluation-and?autologincheck=redirected">guidance on childhood obesity</a> in 15 years from the American Academy of Pediatrics. “What we see is a continuation of weight gain and the likelihood that they’ll have (obesity) in adulthood.” </p><p>For the first time, the group's guidance sets ages at which kids and teens should be offered medical treatments such as drugs and surgery — in addition to intensive diet, exercise and other behavior and lifestyle interventions, said Eneli, director of the Center for Healthy Weight and Nutrition at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.</p><p>In general, doctors should offer adolescents 12 and older who have obesity access to appropriate drugs and teens 13 and older with severe obesity referrals for weight-loss surgery, though situations may vary. </p><div id="afs:Card:029281580227" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="c48d5896114beea7eda31d7b8b25461d">Hub peek embed (apf-Health) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The guidelines aim to reset the inaccurate view of obesity as “a personal problem, maybe a failure of the person’s diligence,” said Dr. Sandra Hassink, medical director for the AAP Institute for Healthy Childhood Weight, and a co-author of the guidelines. </p><p>“This is not different than you have asthma and now we have an inhaler for you,” Hassink said. </p><p>Young people who have a body mass index that meets or exceeds the 95th percentile for kids of the same age and gender are considered obese. Kids who reach or exceed that level by 120% are considered to have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-chicago-obesity-children-686ed01aa71103aa9e2848f5a704d07d">severe obesity</a>. BMI is a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/index.html">measure of body size</a> based on a calculation of height and weight. </p><p>Obesity affects nearly 20% of kids and teens in the U.S. and about 42% of adults, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p><p>The group's guidance takes into consideration that obesity is a biological problem and that the condition is a complex, chronic disease, said Aaron Kelly, co-director of the Center for Pediatric Obesity Medicine at the University of Minnesota.</p><p>“Obesity is not a lifestyle problem. It is not a lifestyle disease,” he said. “It predominately emerges from biological factors.”</p><p>The guidelines come as new drug treatments for obesity in kids have emerged, including approval late last month of Wegovy, a weekly injection, for use in children ages 12 and older. Different doses of the drug, called semaglutide, are also used under different names to treat diabetes. <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2208601">A recent study</a> published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that Wegovy, made by Novo Nordisk, helped teens reduce their BMI by about 16% on average, better than the results in adults. </p><p>Within days of the Dec. 23 authorization, pediatrician Dr. Claudia Fox had prescribed the drug for one of her patients, a 12-year-old girl. </p><p>“What it offers patients is the possibility of even having an almost normal body mass index,” said Fox, also a weight management specialist at the University of Minnesota. “It’s like a whole different level of improvement.” </p><p>The drug affects how the pathways between the brain and the gut regulate energy, said Dr. Justin Ryder, an obesity researcher at Lurie Children’s Hospital in Chicago.</p><p>“It works on how your brain and stomach communicate with one another and helps you feel more full than you would be,” he said. </p><p>Still, specific doses of semaglutide and other anti-obesity drugs have been hard to get because of recent shortages caused by manufacturing problems and high demand, spurred in part by celebrities on TikTok and other social media platforms boasting about enhanced weight loss. </p><p>In addition, many insurers won’t pay for the medication, which costs about $1,300 a month. “I sent the prescription yesterday,” Fox said. “I’m not holding my breath that insurance will cover it.”</p><p>One expert in pediatric obesity cautioned that while kids with obesity must be treated early and intensively, he worries that some doctors may turn too quickly to drugs or surgery. </p><p>“It’s not that I’m against the medications,” said Dr. Robert Lustig, a longtime specialist in pediatric endocrinology at the University of California, San Francisco. “I’m against the willy-nilly use of those medications without addressing the cause of the problem.” </p><p>Lustig said children must be evaluated individually to understand all of the factors that contribute to obesity. He has long blamed too much sugar for the rise in obesity. He urges a sharp focus on diet, particularly ultraprocessed foods that are high in sugar and low in fiber.</p><p>Dr. Stephanie Byrne, a pediatrician at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, said she'd like more research about the drug’s efficacy in a more diverse group of children and about potential long-term effects before she begins prescribing it regularly. </p><p>“I would want to see it be used on a little more consistent basis,” she said. “And I would have to have that patient come in pretty frequently to be monitored.” </p><p>At the same time, she welcomed the group's new emphasis on prompt, intensive treatment for obesity in kids. </p><p>“I definitely think this is a realization that diet and exercise is not going to do it for a number of teens who are struggling with this – maybe the majority,” she said.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

            <description><![CDATA[<figure><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/9c4f5ee7e6084463a5b5da0fb08b09e8/3000.jpeg" alt="Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady (12) sets back to pass during the first half of an NFL football game against the Atlanta Falcons, Sunday, Jan. 8, 2023, in Atlanta.

(AP Photo/John Bazemore)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>Seven of the 14 teams in this year's playoffs didn't make the field last season, giving the NFL's upcoming wild-card weekend a mix of traditional powerhouses and underdogs.</p><p>Tom Brady begins his quest for an unprecedented eighth Super Bowl title when his Tampa Bay Buccaneers host the Dallas Cowboys next Monday night. Meanwhile, Jacksonville second-year standout Trevor Lawrence and Seattle veteran Geno Smith will be among at least five quarterbacks making their playoff debuts.</p><p>The schedule is set: In the AFC, it’ll be the Los Angeles Chargers at Jacksonville, Miami at Buffalo and Baltimore at Cincinnati. In the NFC, it's Seattle at San Francisco to begin the playoff slate, followed by the New York Giants at Minnesota and Dallas at Tampa Bay.</p><p>The Seahawks were the last team to make the field <a href="https://apnews.com/article/green-bay-packers-seattle-seahawks-los-angeles-rams-detroit-lions-sports-666251bf430dc399920439443991f297">after Detroit beat Green Bay 20-16 on Sunday night</a>. The Lions were eliminated from playoff contention earlier Sunday when the Seattle beat the Rams, but Detroit pushed past the disappointment to deny Aaron Rodgers and the division rival Packers a spot in the postseason.</p><p>The Lions' win capped a Week 18 that saw the Dolphins make it back to the playoffs for the first time since 2016. The surprising Jaguars also return to the postseason for just the second time since 2007.</p><p>Among those who didn't make the cut: <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-england-patriots-buffalo-bills-miami-dolphins-york-jets-nfl-25243cdf2ceb3780419859fc39537ef4">The New England Patriots</a> and six-time Super Bowl-winning coach Bill Belichick, eliminated after a loss to the Bills.</p><p>The No. 1 overall seed in the AFC was claimed by Kansas City with its 31-13 win over Las Vegas on Saturday. The NFC's top spot was taken by Philadelphia, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/philadelphia-eagles-new-york-giants-sports-jalen-hurts-nfl-football-a80233e214f9e1b60db676bd2e5b6342">which beat the Giants 22-16</a> on Sunday.</p><div id="afs:Card:103854648961" content-id="05b7768e4388d57e68983ceacaedf6ab" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (NFL) - Compressed layout </div><p>Here's a look at some other developments as the postseason approaches: </p><h2>WHAT'S THE WILD-CARD SCHEDULE?</h2><p>SATURDAY</p><p>Seattle Seahawks at San Francisco 49ers, 4:30 p.m. EST, Fox</p><p>Los Angeles Chargers at Jacksonville Jaguars, 8:15 p.m. EST, NBC</p><p>SUNDAY</p><p>Miami Dolphins at Buffalo Bills, 1 p.m. EST, CBS</p><p>New York Giants at Minnesota Vikings, 4:30 p.m. EST, Fox</p><p>Baltimore Ravens at Cincinnati Bengals, 8:15 p.m. EST, NBC</p><p>MONDAY</p><p>Dallas Cowboys at Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 8:15 p.m. EST, ESPN/ABC</p><h2>WHAT'S THE FORMAT FOR THE PLAYOFFS?</h2><p>This is the third straight year of the current NFL playoff format, which includes the top seven teams from both the AFC and the NFC.</p><p>The four division winners in both conferences automatically get the top four seeds, regardless of record, and then the top three teams with the best record that didn't win their division are the wild-card selections. That's why it's fairly common for a wild-card selection to have a better record — but worse playoff seeding — than a team that finished as a division winner.</p><p>The No. 1-seeded team in each conference gets a bye into the second round — that's the Chiefs and Eagles — while No. 2 hosts No. 7, No. 3 hosts No. 6 and No. 4 hosts No. 5 during the wild-card weekend.</p><p>The NFL re-seeds teams after each playoff round. That means no matter how the bracket started, the lowest-seeded team will always travel to the highest-seeded team. </p><p>There are four rounds to the playoffs: The wild-card round is during the upcoming weekend, the divisional round is Jan. 21-22, the conference championship games are on Jan. 29 and the Super Bowl is scheduled for Feb. 12 in Glendale, Arizona.</p><h2>WHAT CHANGED WITH THE BILLS-BENGALS CANCELLATION?</h2><p>Players and fans watched in horror Monday night <a href="https://apnews.com/article/damar-hamlin-collapse-buffalo-bills-cincinnati-bengals-c9f684bdaccd1e3f77bda6c77baca75e">as Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin collapsed</a> on the field at Cincinnati when his heart stopped and had to be given CPR before leaving the field in an ambulance. A few days later, those same players and fans <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-england-patriots-buffalo-bills-sports-nfl-football-damar-hamlin-47dc11b56ec33560542cd3847db4de45">reacted with joy</a> at news of Hamlin's recovery.</p><p>That made it easier to focus on Week 18 and now the playoffs.</p><p>The cancellation of the Bills-Bengals game because of Hamlin's injury could lead to one big change to the AFC playoff format.</p><p>The AFC championship game would be played on a neutral site if the Chiefs and Bills reach that point under a rule adjustment approved by NFL owners last Friday. That's because Buffalo (13-3) played one fewer game than Kansas City (14-3) and missed out on a chance to earn the top seed. The Bills beat the Chiefs 24-20 on Oct. 16 and would have held the tiebreaker had the teams finished with the same record. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/cincinnati-bengals-kansas-city-chiefs-buffalo-bills-nfl-sports-060041ec1dd4c9bea035ca7283fa5e7a">Buffalo lost 42-36 at Kansas City</a> in a divisional-round classic last season.</p><p>The Chiefs would host the AFC title game against any other team, including the third-seeded Bengals (12-4).</p><h2>WHAT ARE THE GOOD WILD-CARD GAMES?</h2><p>There's not a bad matchup in the bunch but a couple stand out.</p><p>— Cowboys at Bucs: Brady suffered through his first losing season in his 23-year career, but even at 8-9, the Bucs won the NFC South. They'll face the Cowboys, who were 12-5 and always attract a white-hot spotlight.</p><p>— Ravens at Bengals: It's the third time these AFC North rivals will meet this season. Former MVP Lamar Jackson could return at quarterback for the Ravens after missing several weeks because of a knee injury. He'll face the Bengals and Joe Burrow, who lost the Super Bowl to the Rams last season.</p><p>— Chargers at Jaguars: This one features two of the NFL's best young quarterbacks, both of whom are making their playoff debuts. Jacksonville's Lawrence took a big step forward in his second season while LA's Justin Herbert has compiled impressive numbers during his three years in the league.</p><p>___</p><p>AP Pro Football Writer Rob Maaddi contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL </p>]]></description>
