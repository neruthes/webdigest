Carlos Correa’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-york-mets-minnesota-twins-san-francisco-giants-mlb-sports-2801627f4859552fecd99dcb92f742e5">free-agent destination</a> was decided by MRIs.</p><p>At the end of the most convoluted high-profile free-agent negotiation in baseball history, the small-market Minnesota Twins ended up with the All-Star shortstop — and not the San Francisco Giants or New York Mets — because of their doctors' comfort with Correa's surgicaly repaired right leg.</p><p>San Francisco balked at finalizing a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mlb-sports-health-carlos-correa-san-francisco-giants-73159d64cc866bb5c650f74276e807f5">$350 million, 13-year contract</a> with the 28-year-old, and then the Mets hesitated to close a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/carlos-correa-mets-giants-physical-steve-cohen-7eabd5d9a1980cb33a1c754938c41a53">$315 million, 12-year deal</a>, both after a scan of Correa's tibia alarmed their physicians.</p><p>As it turned out, those concerns cost Correa over $100 million in guaranteed money.</p><p>Correa, best known as the shortstop for the 2017 World Series champion Houston Astros, spent 2022 with Minnesota. The team's medical staff, having examined the two-time All-Star several times over the past year, felt more comfortable with the ankle, which was repaired in 2014.</p><p>And so the Twins went ahead with a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-york-mets-minnesota-twins-san-francisco-giants-mlb-sports-2801627f4859552fecd99dcb92f742e5">$200 million, six-year agreement</a> that was finalized Wednesday — 29 days after Correa agreed with the Giants and 21 days after he struck a deal with the Mets.</p><p>Right back where he started. Here's a look at how he got there:</p><div id="afs:Card:519906141437" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="271a482bcf7c704282cfb94f1ccb68c1">Hub peek embed (MLB) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>WHY DID THE DEALS WITH THE GIANTS AND METS COLLAPSE?</p><p>Correa injured his right leg in 2014 while playing with the Class A Lancaster JetHawks, and doctors inserted a metal plate during surgery to repair it. The consternation centers on whether the ankle healed in a way that might hinder Correa as he ages.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Correa's agent, Scott Boras, maintains it's only a question of “pain tolerance.”</p><p>“It’s not a functionality," Boras said Wednesday at Correa's introductory news conference in Minnesota. "It’s just how long you weather the pain to play, and he has never had complaints. Will he have complaints in the future? And the answer is he hasn’t had complaints after eight years in the major leagues, and the functional fitness orthopedists say it’s unlikely he will going forward.”</p><p>Boras cited a split among orthopedists and surgeons, maintaining orthopedists believe “almost a Darwinian concept where you actually grow into a formation of your being able to compete and perform.”</p><p>According to Boras, the Giants and the Mets both relied on opinions from the same specialist — Dr. Robert Anderson, a Green Bay Packers associate team physician who operated on Derek Jeter's broken left ankle in 2012. Boras said Giants team orthopedist Dr. Ken Akizuki consulted with Anderson directly, while the Mets team at the Hospital for Special Surgery relied on foot and ankle specialist Dr. Mark Drakos — who also consulted with Anderson.</p><p>Meanwhile, Los Angeles Dodgers head team physician Dr. Neal ElAttrache, a noted orthopedist, examined Correa ahead of free agency last offseason. Correa was also looked at prior to last March's deal with Minnesota and again at the end of this past season by Dr. Christopher Camp, the Twins’ medical director and director of high performance as well as an orthopedist at the Mayo Clinic.</p><p>“Dr. ElAttrache (was) telling me that the ankle is great, it’s in great shape. Dr. Camp here telling me that I’m in outstanding shape, even better than last year,” Correa said.</p><p>“One thing I learned throughout the whole process was that doctors have a difference of opinions," he added. “I had a lot of doctors tell me that I was fine. I had some doctors that said it wasn’t so fine. It was shocking to me because since I had the surgery, I never missed a game. I never got a treatment in my ankle."</p><p>The ankle has bothered Correa on at least one occasion, when he came up slowly after a hard slide into second base during a game last Sept. 20.</p><p>“He just hit my plate,” Correa told reporters at the time. “I had surgery and he hit it. Just kind of felt numb. Vibrating. So I was just waiting for it to calm down. It was a little scary, but when I moved I knew I was good.”</p><p>Correa hit .319 in the final 12 games of the 2022 season after that slide.</p><p>HOW DID THE TWINS END UP WITH CORREA?</p><p>Twins president of baseball operations Derek Falvey kept calling Boras throughout the free-agent process, even after the deals were reached with the Giants and the Mets. New York owner Steve Cohen aggressively pursued Correa after San Francisco’s agreement stalled, which Boras said precluded talks with the Twins. </p><p>After Correa’s physical for the Mets, New York proposed cutting its guarantee in half to $157.5 million.</p><p>“Sometimes in baseball as in life and everywhere else, fate and destiny come back together and there’s an opportunity that you don’t always expect," Falvey said. "The journeys are not always linear. They’re circuitous sometimes.”</p><p>Correa earned $35.1 million from the Twins last season before opting out of the remainder of a $105.3 million, three-year contract. The Twins offered Correa $285 million over 10 seasons earlier this offseason. In the end, Correa agreed to a deal with four option years that could boost its value to $270 million over a decade if he plays regularly.</p><p>Boras received a call from Falvey just after Christmas, and the agent told him Minnesota may have an opportunity. Last week, Boras called Falvey back.</p><p>“We should start discussing a very serious dynamic about getting this done," Boras recalled saying. "I've had five, six teams contact me,' and I let him know, 'I'm only talking to you.'”</p><p>Boras said he spoke with Camp five times and sent him all the MRIs made available to the Mets.</p><p>“We’re not here to fault exterior physicians and their opinions, but I will say that medicine, particularly in sport, orthopedic functionality and clinical exam on a day-to-day basis is far more important than an MRI,” he said. “The orthopedists, they're operating on function, saying unless they have evidence to show the degenerative nature, it's all speculation.”</p><p>Boras maintained the Mets, led by chief legal officer Katie Pothier, tried to weaken the guarantee language.</p><p>“There was an agenda going on there that was far afield from deal-making,” he said. “There was an agenda where they felt that they could move a negotiation to a different place.”</p><p>Boras said he sent Cohen a text on Sunday or Monday telling him Correa wouldn't accept the Mets' proposed language and was turning to other teams.</p><p>The Mets issued only a brief statement Wednesday, shortly before Correa was introduced as a Twin.</p><p>“We were unable to reach an agreement," the team said. "We wish Carlos all the best.”</p><p>___</p><p>AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports </p>]]></description>

(Laurent Gillieron/Keystone via AP, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>NEW YORK (AP) — <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/jeff-beck">Jeff Beck,</a> a guitar virtuoso who pushed the boundaries of blues, jazz and rock ‘n’ roll, influencing generations of shredders along the way and becoming known as the guitar player’s guitar player, has died. He was 78.</p><p>Beck died Tuesday after “suddenly contracting bacterial meningitis,” his representatives said in a statement released Wednesday. The location was not immediately known.</p><p>“Jeff was such a nice person and an outstanding iconic, genius guitar player — there will never be another Jeff Beck,” Tony Iommi, guitarist for Black Sabbath wrote on Twitter <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jeff-beck-tributes-3cc24e8231950c487fdb0a9f607c50b0">among the many tributes.</a></p><p>Beck first came to prominence as a member of the Yardbirds and then went out on his own in a solo career that incorporated hard rock, jazz, funky blues and even opera. He was known for his improvising, love of harmonics and the whammy bar on his preferred guitar, the Fender Stratocaster. </p><p>“Jeff Beck is the best guitar player on the planet," Joe Perry, the lead guitarist of Aerosmith, told The New York Times in 2010. "He is head, hands and feet above all the rest of us, with the kind of talent that appears only once every generation or two.”</p><p>Beck was among the rock-guitarist pantheon from the late ’60s that included Eric Clapton, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/eddb0e43705d44d59931203bc3516beb">Jimmy Page</a> and Jimi Hendrix. Beck won eight Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice — once with the Yardbirds in 1992 and again as a solo artist in 2009. He was ranked fifth in Rolling Stone magazine’s list of the “100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.”</p><div id="afs:Card:958899307023" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="6fafc82a3f8fe8e27d6f6e39a215e28d">Hub peek embed (apf-entertainment) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“Jeff could channel music from the ethereal,” Page tweeted Wednesday.</p><p>Beck played guitar with vocalists as varied as Luciano Pavarotti, Macy Gray, Chrissie Hynde, Joss Stone, Imelda May, Cyndi Lauper, Wynonna Judd, Buddy Guy <a href="https://apnews.com/article/johnny-depp-entertainment-marvin-gaye-music-4edb776cdca94413af0ad294a1a14681">and Johnny Depp.</a> He made two records with Rod Stewart — 1968's “Truth” and 1969's “Beck-Ola” — and one with a 64-piece orchestra, “Emotion &amp; Commotion.” </p><p>“I like an element of chaos in music. That feeling is the best thing ever, as long as you don’t have too much of it. It’s got to be in balance. I just saw Cirque du Soleil, and it struck me as complete organized chaos,” he told Guitar World in 2014. “If I could turn that into music, it’s not far away from what my ultimate goal would be, which is to delight people with chaos and beauty at the same time.”</p><p>Beck career highlights include joining with bassist Tim Bogert and drummer Carmine Appice to create the power trio that released “Beck, Bogert and Appice” in 1973, tours with Brian Wilson and Buddy Guy and a tribute album to the late guitarist Les Paul, “Rock ‘n’ Roll Party (Honoring Les Paul).”</p><p>Beck’s album credits include “Talking Book,” Stevie Wonder’s landmark 1972 album. His tenderly rendered guitar solo on the ballad, “Lookin' For Another Pure Love” won him a warm “Do it Jeff” callout from Wonder that was included on the album cut.</p><p>Geoffrey Arnold Beck was born in Surrey, England, and attended Wimbledon Art College. His father was an accountant, and his mother worked in a chocolate factory. As a boy, he built his first instrument, using a cigar box, a picture frame for the neck and string from a radio-controlled toy airplane. </p><p>He was in a few bands — including Nightshift and The Tridents — before joining the Yardbirds in 1965, replacing Clapton but only a year later giving way to Page. During his tenure, the band created the memorable singles “Heart Full of Soul,” “I’m a Man” and “Shapes of Things.” </p><p>Beck’s first hit single was 1967’s instrumental “Beck’s Bolero,” which featured future Led Zeppelin members Page and John Paul Jones, and The Who drummer Keith Moon. The Jeff Beck Group — with Stewart singing — was later booked to play the 1969 Woodstock music festival but their appearance was canceled. Beck later said there was unrest in the band. </p><p>“I could see the end of the tunnel,” he told Rolling Stone in 2010.</p><p>Beck was friends with Hendrix and they performed together. Before Hendrix, most rock guitar players concentrated on a similar style and technical vocabulary. Hendrix blew that apart. </p><p>“He came along and reset all of the rules in one evening,” Beck told Guitar World. </p><p>Beck teamed up with <a href="https://apnews.com/article/b7f8fea087bc4330b7803801487ac49e">legendary producer George Martin</a> — a.k.a. “the fifth Beatle” — to help him fashion the genre-melding, jazz-fusion classic “Blow by Blow” (1975) and “Wired” (1976). He teamed up with Seal on the Hendrix tribute “Stone Free,” created a jazz-fusion group led by synthesizer player Jan Hammer and honored rockabilly guitarist Cliff Gallup with the album “Crazy Legs.” He put out “Loud Hailer” in 2016.</p><p>Beck’s guitar work can be heard on the soundtracks of such films as “Stomp the Yard,” “Shallow Hal,” “Casino,” “Honeymoon in Vegas,” “Twins,” “Observe and Report” and “Little Big League.” Beck recently completed a tour supporting his album with Depp, “18” and was heard on Ozzy Osbourne's “Patient Number 9” album.</p><p>Beck’s career never hit the commercial highs of Clapton. A perfectionist, he preferred to make critically well-received instrumental records and left the limelight for long stretches, enjoying his time restoring vintage automobiles. He and Clapton had a tense relationship early on but became friends in later life and toured together.</p><p>Why did the two wait some four decades to tour together? </p><p>“Because we were all trying to be big bananas,” Beck told Rolling Stone in 2010. “Except I didn’t have the luxury of the hit songs Eric’s got.”</p><p>Beck is survived by his wife, Sandra.</p><p>___</p><p>AP reporter Scott Stroud in Nashville contributed to this report.</p><p>___ </p><p>Mark Kennedy is at <a href="http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits">http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits</a></p>]]></description>

U.S. District Judge George Caram Steeh barred the museum from moving it, a temporary step before a court hearing on Jan. 19.</p><p>The painting is worth more than $5 million, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>The museum declined to comment on the dispute but said “no allegation of misconduct by the DIA has been alleged.”</p><p>The oil-on-canvas painting indicates that it’s on loan from a collection in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Crystal Dunn was often the only Black girl on her youth soccer clubs, and even when she finally made it to the national team, she did her own hair and makeup for photo shoots because “there wasn't someone set up for me."</p><p>While the U.S. national team has steadily become more representative, Dunn says there's still work to be done. That starts with making sure young women of color feel included all the way down to the youth level.</p><p>“I had very supportive parents who explained to me that, 'This is OK, you are still welcome in this sport. And just because there aren’t many people that look like you, this is still your game,'" Dunn said. That support was key to her success "because honestly at the end of the day, it’s pretty lonely to feel like you’re the only one in this space and to not feel as if you belong.”</p><p>Women’s soccer in the United States has long had a diversity problem: The sport's pay-to-play model means that it's expensive, especially at higher levels. Club teams and traveling teams can cost thousands of dollars in some cases. Almost from the start, players without financial resources — including many from marginalized communities — are left behind.</p><p>Even U.S. Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone has lamented that American soccer is seen as a “rich, white kids’ sport.”</p><div id="afs:Card:875733071197" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="a7b7fd7f889042bc86039832f4ec19c2">Hub peek embed (Soccer) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Dunn first played for the national team in 2013 and was on the squad that won the 2019 World Cup in France. The job also involved off-field duties such as participating in professional photo shoots and public appearances.</p><p>Such events often included hair and makeup assistance for white players, but with no guarantee that the stylists would know how to work with Black skin or Black hair.</p><p>"Those are things that a lot of people didn’t ever have to think about because there weren’t that many of us,” Dunn said.</p><p>She was among just five players of color out of 23 on the roster for the World Cup-winning team. In contrast, France had 12.</p><p>The most recent U.S. roster had 10 women of color — including young stars Trinity Rodman, Naomi Girma and Mallory (Pugh) Swanson — as the team readies for this summer's World Cup. The United States will face New Zealand twice next week as the teams ramp up for the tournament, which will be co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand.</p><p>“Representation matters,” said Sophia Smith, who had a team-high 11 goals for the United States last year and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sports-soccer-mia-hamm-fifa-world-cup-lindsey-horan-d85c0b6194deab53f0c3776699322507">won U.S. Soccer's Female Player of the Year award</a>. “And I think for young girls to be able to look on the screen or come to a game and see a lot of people that look different, it’s great.”</p><p>The growing representation has helped diversify a team that included fewer than a dozen total Black players in its entire history before 2012.</p><p>The pool of players talented enough to each the highest level in America — the national team and the National Women's Soccer League — is already small. The exclusionary nature of youth soccer makes it even smaller.</p><p>The pay-to-play structure “does leave a lot of marginalized minority communities in a pickle” because of the high costs, Dunn said. "And if I didn’t have parents who could dish out three, four or five grand a year, I don’t know that I can sit here and say that I would have continued playing this sport.”</p><p>Parlow Cone said at a youth sports panel last year that the U.S. federation is studying access to the game.</p><p>“A lot of it comes down to how our sport is viewed, marketing, and how do we shift that thinking from that it’s a rich white kids' sport to this is a sport that is literally played in every country around the world?" she said. “And as the most diverse country in the world here in the U.S., how do we change that focus to making sure that every kid feels welcomed into our game?"</p><p>Ed Foster-Simeon, CEO of the U.S. Soccer Foundation, is among those trying to make soccer more accessible to communities that haven't traditionally been involved.</p><p>The foundation’s Soccer for Success program has worked with more than 400,000 children – 90% of them from communities of color — since 2008. The program expects to serve more than 100,000 kids this year.</p><p>The foundation says that more than 121,000 girls from underserved communities have benefited from its programs over the past three years — part of its United For Girls initiative launched after the 2019 World Cup. Additionally, the foundation has engaged 5,475 coaches who identify as women or nonbinary over that period.</p><p>The foundation's goal is not to develop elite talent but to bring the game to more kids, particularly those in communities with fewer resources, he said.</p><p>In the last few years, “clearer and clearer pathways” have emerged for talented young people, Foster-Simeon said. “But I think our biggest challenge still today is that we’re only scratching the surface in terms of participation. We are not reaching enough kids.”</p><p>Indeed, much of the work with girls is being done at the grassroots level.</p><p>Shannon Boxx, who was enshrined last year into the National Soccer Hall of Fame, played on the national team from 2003 to 2015. She's on the board of Bridge City Soccer in Portland — which aims to bring girls into the game.</p><p>She remembers moments on the national team when she noticed she was the only person of color present.</p><p>“For me, it was just a big weight that I was willing to have, but I remember feeling like, OK, when we’re signing autographs, I’m searching for those kids that are of color because I want them to know that they can do this,” she said. “And I might be the only one right now, but that’s not going to be the way it is in the future.”</p><p>Shawna Gordon, a former pro who played for Sky Blue (now Gotham FC) in the National Women's Soccer League, started the nonprofit Football For Her in Southern California to mentor young players on and off the pitch — regardless of socioeconomic status. Football For Her takes a whole person approach, addressing nutrition and mental health, in addition to playing skills.</p><p>“It's a challenge to be playing with hard players, like they're all talented in their own ways. And for me, that gets to help me find my why,” said Amber Ramirez, 13, who attended a Friday night Soccer For Her program last fall.</p><p>There's evidence those efforts may be working. Ten years ago, just 24% of Division I women’s soccer players were nonwhite. The number grew to 34% last season.</p><p>But many believe stopgap measures are not the answer. They want to reconsider the pay-to-play model.</p><p>The pay-to-play model "is completely endemic to the issues that we’re having, so how do we try to adjust it?” said Kate Markgraf, general manager of the U.S. women. "I think we’re finally at a point now where we’re willing — not as U.S. Soccer, but I think as a society — our eyes are open in a way that they never have been.”</p><p>Dunn is hopeful. When she first joined the national team, there were many fewer women of color in the sport and even fewer who were playing at the highest levels.</p><p>It’s important to celebrate progress, she said, "but it's also important to continue pushing, pushing for more and pushing for more women of color to be able to have access to the sport.”</p><p>___</p><p>AP Sports Writer Joe Reedy in Los Angeles contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>More AP soccer: <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/soccer">https://apnews.com/hub/soccer</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/AP_Sports">https://twitter.com/AP_Sports</a></p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Eraldo Peres)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>BRASILIA, Brasil (AP) — Brazil’s capital prepared for the possibility of more violent demonstrations Wednesday by people seeking to overturn the presidential election, with local security officials blocking access to buildings trashed four days earlier by a horde of rioters.</p><p>A flyer promoting a “mega-protest to retake power” circulated on social media platforms, particularly Telegram, and urged protesters to turn out in two dozen cities, including the capital. It was unclear how large or violent such demonstrations might shape up to be, but skittish authorities took no chances. </p><p>Speaking to journalists in Brasilia, the federal appointee who has assumed control of the capital’s security said police were shutting down the main avenue to traffic and limiting pedestrian access with barricades. They are blocking all access to the square that was the site of Sunday's mayhem, said the official, Ricarado Cappelli. </p><p>He said a small area on the avenue has been reserved for peaceful demonstrations, but will be surrounded by police and the national guard and all protesters searched upon entry.</p><p>“The right to protest freely will always be respected and cannot be confused with terrorism,” Cappelli said. </p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="9326ee60c21c9ff0abdb81f0c5a9a1ce">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Citing the call to action on social media, a Supreme Court justice ordered local authorities in cities across Brazil to prevent protesters from blocking roads or occupying public spaces and buildings. Justice Alexandre de Moraes also ordered arrests and fines for people and companies who participate or help with logistics and funding. </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The nation remains on edge after supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro rampaged through Congress, the Supreme Court and the presidential palace on Sunday, laying ruin to the government’s three most important buildings. Officials arrested or detained some 1,500 people by the following morning, hundreds of whom were sent to prison. </p><p>Though there is no evidence of fraud in the Oct. 30 presidential election, the protesters have claimed the true winner was far-right Bolsonaro. He has fired up his base about the vulnerability of electronic voting machines despite independent experts' assurances they are closely scrutinized. Bolsonaro also has warned his supporters that the election's leftist victor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, would impose communism. </p><p>The fresh call for an uprising Wednesday sparked concern that the crackdown hadn't damped the will of radicals. Among those who vow to continue struggling is Daniel Bressan, 35, who traveled some 300 miles from the interior of Parana state to join Sunday's protest in Brasilia. He was detained by police the next morning, though he denies participating in any of the vandalism. </p><p>“A lot of people are going to be afraid to go to the streets and be arrested — I myself fear persecution by the legal system — but I’m not going to stop fighting and I’m not going to get discouraged,” Bressan said by phone from the federal police’s temporary holding center. “I’m ready for everything. Our freedom is worth more than our lives.” </p><p>Jailing rioters represents only part of the government’s effort to hold people responsible, with authorities also seeking to track down those who enabled the uprising. That includes organizers who summoned protesters to the capital and paid their way as well as local security personnel accused of either standing by and allowing the destruction to occur, or even cooperating. </p><p>Justice Minister Flávio Dino told local press this week that authorities have identified some of the protest’s financiers. He said they are based in the south and center-west regions that Bolsonaro carried in the election. Without identifying individuals, he said they are members of the agribusiness sector, local business owners and people registered to own firearms. </p><p>Dino previously said the riot was apparently intended to spark a domino effect around the country. He has referred to the encampments that had been set up by Bolsonaro supporters outside military buildings to call on the armed forces to overturn election results as “incubators of terrorists.” Authorities cleared away the camps in Brasilia and other cities after the rioting.</p><p>In November, the Supreme Court froze 43 bank accounts of people accused of having financed roadblocks that disrupted highway traffic in the wake of Lula’s victory. At least 30 were in the center-west state of Mato Grosso, Brazil’s top soybean producer.</p><p>De Moraes, the Supreme Court justice, also ordered preventative detention for the men who were serving Sunday as head of the federal district’s security and military police chief, as well as searches of their residences. Both men have been fired since the rioting. </p><p>“Absolutely NOTHING justifies the omission and collusion of the security secretary and the military police commander,” de Moraes wrote in his decision, which was made public late Tuesday. </p><p>The justice also denounced the protest encampments sponsored by diverse financiers. </p><p>“There are strong indications that the conduct of criminal terrorists could only have occurred with the willful participation or omission — which will be determined in these investigations — of the aforementioned public authorities,” de Moraes wrote. </p><p>The fired security secretary, Anderson Torres, had been Bolsonaro’s justice minister. Cappelli, the federal appointee who now controls the secretariat, said Wednesday that Torres assumed his new position, immediately fired subordinates and then traveled to Florida. </p><p>Cappelli previously told local media there were signs Torres' actions amounted to intentional sabotage of security ahead of Sunday's violence. </p><p>Torres said Tuesday night on Twitter that he was interrupting his vacation and returning to Brazil to present his defense. He said ethics and legality had always governed his actions.</p><p>___</p><p>Scarabotto reported from Rio de Janeiro.</p>]]></description>

James Comer, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said in a statement. </p><p>The Republican-led committee sent a series of letters requesting financial information from the Treasury Department about financial transactions by members of the Biden family that were flagged as suspicious activity. Those reports are routine, with larger financial transactions automatically flagged to the government, and are not evidence on their own of misconduct.</p><p>Lawmakers also requested testimony from multiple former Twitter executives who were involved in the company's handling of an October 2020 story from the New York Post about Hunter Biden, the president's younger son. Republicans say that story was suppressed for political reasons. </p><p>Moving quickly after taking control of the House, Republicans are setting up a messy, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-inflation-donald-trump-business-9af868065b776b21f81fa73e7bafb97d">politically explosive showdown with the White House</a> that could delve deeply into the affairs of the president’s family and shape the contours of the 2024 race for the White House.</p><div id="afs:Card:130243251955" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="b80e36533fa8da85199fe397d2b50d85">Hub peek embed (JoeBiden) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“In their first week as a governing majority, House Republicans have not taken any meaningful action to address inflation and lower Americans’ costs, yet they’re jumping out of the gate with political stunts driven by the most extreme MAGA members of their caucus in an effort to get attention on Fox News," Ian Sams, a White House spokesman, said in a statement, referring to former President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, Make America Great Again. </p><p>In a statement, Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, the senior Democrat on Oversight, echoed the White House sentiment, saying Democrats will work with Republicans “when they get serious about tackling problems that affect the American people.”</p><p>The Treasury Department declined to comment. </p><p>Comer and other Republicans set out their plan for probing the Biden family the day after clinching a slim majority in the November midterm elections. The Kentucky Republican told reporters there are “troubling questions,” specifically about the business dealings of Hunter Biden and one of the president’s brothers, James Biden, that require deeper investigation.</p><p>GOP <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-2022-midterm-elections-biden-europe-elise-stefanik-0e782fc6486c2c625194622ae244e4ae">investigations into the Biden family are nothing new</a>. Republican lawmakers and their staff have been analyzing messages and financial transactions found on a laptop that belonged to Hunter Biden for the past year. Comer told reporters late Wednesday that he's been in touch with GOP Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who led the investigative efforts against Hunter Biden in the Senate, and there is information sharing between the two chambers. </p><p>But Republicans now have subpoena power in the House, giving them the authority to compel testimony and conduct a far more aggressive investigation. </p><p>Republicans have discussed issuing congressional subpoenas to foreign entities that did business with Hunter Biden, and they recently brought on James Mandolfo, a former federal prosecutor, to assist with the investigation as general counsel for the Oversight panel.</p><p>Hunter Biden’s taxes and foreign business work are already under federal investigation, with <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-biden-business-trump-impeachment-presidential-elections-073e76b799fef4560ca3a9089d80d7fa">a grand jury in Delaware hearing testimony</a> in recent months. While he never held a position on the presidential campaign or in the White House, his membership on the board of a Ukrainian energy company and his efforts to strike deals in China have long raised questions about whether he traded on his father’s public service, including reported references in his emails to the “big guy.”</p><p>Joe Biden has said he’s never spoken to his son about his foreign business. And there are no indications that the federal investigation involves the president in any way.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Zeke Miller, Fatima Hussein and Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report. </p>]]></description>

(Jan. 11)</p>    <p>ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — The “Prayers for Damar 3” have been answered. Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin is finally home.</p><p>Nine days after he stunned and saddened his teammates by going into cardiac arrest and being resuscitated on the field in Cincinnati, and placed the NFL on hold, Hamlin was released from a Buffalo hospital on Wednesday, the Bills announced.</p><p>“We have completed a series of tests and evaluation and in consultation with the team physicians, we are confident that Damar can be safely discharged,” Dr. Jamie Nadler said in a news release issued by the team.</p><p>This marks the next major step in what doctors have called Hamlin’s remarkable recovery, which came two days after he was deemed healthy enough to be transferred from the University of Cincinnati Medical Center to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/damar-hamlin-buffalo-bills-returns-home-35005f5e4ac87eca56e7d99d49eaec65">the Buffalo General Medical Center</a>. Nadler said the 24-year-old Hamlin will continue his rehabilitation with the Bills.</p><p>The Bills and Nadler did not disclose the results of the tests Hamlin had over the past two days in Buffalo to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/Bills-damar-hamlin-collapse-what-happened-d73a76f2f7f736b652e95896dfaa0900">determine the reason his heart stopped</a> after he struck squarely in the chest by Bengals receiver Tee Higgins while making what appeared to be a routine tackle. Hamlin collapsed during the first quarter of Buffalo’s since-canceled game at Cincinnati on Jan. 2, a chilling scene that played out in front of millions on television.</p><div id="afs:Card:234821764243" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="2a2003b201800d81fedec0d65415190b">Hub peek embed (NFL) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“That just shows the type of kid that he is, how he’s fought and he’s continuing to win,” Bills left tackle Dion Dawkins said. “There’s no place that he would rather be than in his own bed, so blessing to him.”</p><p>As Hamlin's recovery progressed, the Bills and the NFL's messaging switched from “Prayers for Damar 3” to "Love for Damar 3" by last weekend, when the entire league honored Hamlin, who wears No. 3. The Bills and their fans capped an emotionally draining week with a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-england-patriots-buffalo-bills-miami-dolphins-york-jets-nfl-25243cdf2ceb3780419859fc39537ef4">35-23 regular-season-ending victory over New England</a>.</p><p>“It’s an awesome feeling. And we’re just hoping that he’s getting his rest and recovery,” quarterback Josh Allen said Wednesday after practice, where the Bills (13-3) prepared to host their division rival Miami Dolphins (9-8) in a wild-card playoff game on Sunday. “As a team, we’re extremely happy.”</p><div id="1c643143d30d4211924403f73d53a1e5" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>As much as players want to see Hamlin in person, Allen cautioned that moment might have to wait to allow Hamlin to gain his strength.</p><p>“Just making sure he’s taking it slow, and obviously trying to get back to being himself,” Allen added. “So we’ll take all the time that we need. But I hope he knows the guys are ready to see him.”</p><p>Coach Sean McDermott said it would be up to Hamlin to decide when to visit the team, saying: “We’ll welcome him back as he feels ready.”</p><p>Hamlin spent his first two days in hospital under sedation and showed no signs of neurological damage upon being awakened on Jan. 4. By Friday, he was breathing on his own and walking and appeared by videoconference in a team meeting, where he informed the Bills, “Love you boys.”</p><p>On Sunday, Hamlin was live-tweeting during the Bills' victory, with doctors joking he tripped numerous alarms around the intensive care unit while watching teammate Nyheim Hines return the opening kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown.</p><p>Following his transfer to Buffalo, Hamlin posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/HamlinIsland/status/1612880179801595904?s=20&amp;t=UcSCSa_0AZ4LqByBY6zE2g">note on Twitter</a> that read: “Special thank-you to Buffalo General it’s been nothing but love since arrival!” while asking his followers to keep him in their prayers.</p><p>His doctors said Hamlin’s progress in recovering from cardiac arrest, considered a life-threatening event, has been normal to accelerated.</p><p>In the days that followed, $8.6 million in GoFundMe donations poured into <a href="https://apnews.com/article/buffalo-bills-nfl-sports-damar-hamlin-fae1a8983657be78c931731a30648ac1">Hamlin’s toy drive fundraiser</a>, which will be used to support young people through education and sports.</p><p>Hamlin, who is from the Pittsburgh exurb of McKee's Rock, also will use proceeds from the sale of new T-shirts, emblazoned with “Did We Win?” along with his hands in the shape of a heart, to raise money for the trauma center in Cincinnati that initially treated him.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press reporter Carolyn Thompson in Buffalo contributed to this report. </p><p>___</p><p>AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL</p>]]></description>

(Jan. 11) (AP Video: David R. Martin)</p>    <p>NEW YORK (AP) — State and local Republican leaders in New York on Wednesday called for the immediate resignation of their new GOP congressman George Santos, who is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/george-santos-house-of-representatives-d65613ce8bcda757bf3b89c3d0fcfa82">facing multiple investigations by prosecutors</a> over his personal and campaign finances and lies about his resume and family heritage.</p><p>“His lies were not mere fibs. He disgraced the House of Representatives," Joseph Cairo Jr., chair of the Nassau County Republican Committee, said at a news conference. “He’s not welcome here at Republican headquarters."</p><p>Santos, swarmed by reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday, flatly rejected the call to resign, saying, “I will not.”</p><p>The call was an extraordinary rebuke of the freshman congressman whose election months ago flipped a Democratic-held House seat and was initially one of the GOP's highlights of the November election. The denunciation by local Republicans also amps up the pressure on Republicans in Congress to rebuke or sideline Santos. </p><p>Cairo and other Republicans said Santos deceived voters and the local GOP in Long Island's Nassau County, and they were particularly incensed by his lies about having Jewish ancestry.</p><p>Rep. Anthony D’Esposito, another Republican newly elected to represent Long Island, spoke at the news conference via video from Washington and joined Cairo's call for his colleague's resignation.</p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="b2bdca89d67a68343073048b922cb4aa">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“George Santos does not have the ability to serve here in the House of Representatives and should resign,” D'Esposito said.</p><p>The state Republican Party joined the call a few hours later, with chair Nick Langworthy saying in a statement that it was clear Santos “cannot be an effective representative and it would be in the best interest of the taxpayers to have new leadership."</p><p>The state and local parties have no mechanism to remove Santos from office. He was sworn in to the U.S. House last week representing New York’s 3rd Congressional District.</p><p>Santos reiterated his refusal in a post on Twitter later Wednesday.</p><p>“I was elected to serve the people of #NY03 not the party &amp; politicians, I remain committed to doing that and regret to hear that local officials refuse to work with my office to deliver results to keep our community safe and lower the cost of living. I will NOT resign!”</p><div id="a4380859807c45629b7d6b6189d5b912" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>House Speaker Kevin McCarthy stood by Santos on Wednesday, saying that voters had made their choice. </p><p>“The voters made the decision. He has a right to serve. If there is something that rises to the occasion that he did something wrong, then we’ll deal with that later," McCarthy said in Washington. </p><p>The resignation calls come <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-house-of-representatives-new-york-city-us-republican-party-congress-17bfaa6420fb5bf1f8b0c20ffbeac2e9">a day after two Democrats from New York</a> asked the House Ethics Committee to investigate Santos. Reps. Ritchie Torres and Dan Goldman, in a letter to the committee, said Santos also failed to file “timely, accurate and complete” financial disclosure reports and the reports he did file are “sparse and perplexing."</p><p>Earlier this week, the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center lodged a complaint with the Federal Election Commission and urged regulators to investigate Santos. The “mountain of lies” Santos propagated during the campaign about his life story and qualifications, the center said, should prompt the commission to “thoroughly investigate what appear to be equally brazen lies about how his campaign raised and spent money.”</p><p>Initially, the victory by Santos, the only openly gay Republican in Congress, was seen as a bright spot for the party in an otherwise underwhelming midterm election. But as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-business-queens-ae463f9ef3497ce4479f9fe5f2defde1">reports began to emerge</a> that Santos had lied about having Jewish ancestry, a career at top Wall Street firms and a college degree, he turned into a distraction and an embarrassment to the party as it took control of the House.</p><p>During his campaign, he referred to himself as “a proud American Jew.” But he later backtracked on that claim, saying his mother's family had “a Jewish background,” and he told the New York Post in an interview, "I said I was ‘Jew-ish.’”</p><p>Bruce Blakeman, a Jewish Republican and the elected Nassau County Executive, said he and other members of the sizeable Jewish population in the area take their religion and heritage seriously. He said it was “ridiculous” for Santos to call himself a Jew, but said it was "beyond the pale" and “outrageous” for Santos to have said <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/21/politics/george-santos-geneaology/index.html">in an interview that his grandparents survived the Holocaust</a>. </p><p>“He cannot serve anymore. He does not deserve that right," Blakeman said. "He is a stain on the House of Representatives.”</p><p>Blakeman said his office would have no interaction with Santos or his staff until he resigns and that the county would redirect any of Santos' constituents seeking help to the office of D'Esposito in the neighboring congressional district. </p><p>Santos first ran for Congress in 2020, losing to Tom Suozzi, a Democrat. He ran again in 2022, facing Democrat Robert Zimmerman in a district that includes some Long Island suburbs and a small slice of Queens.</p><p>Cairo said Santos was backed by the Nassau GOP after another local Republican club recommended him as a candidate in 2020 and that Santos lied when he presented his resume. He said they would change their vetting process going forward.</p><p>With Santos now, Cairo said, “We do not consider him one of our congresspeople.”</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Ashley Thomas in Washington contributed to this report. </p>]]></description>

Most economists penciled in a recession for 2023.</p><p>An economic downturn is still possible. Yet in recent weeks, with inflation showing widespread signs of easing, a more cheerful view has gained traction: Maybe a recession isn't inevitable after all.</p><p>One reason for the tentative optimism is evidence that an acceleration in U.S. wages, which has benefited workers but also heightened inflation, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-jobs-report-jan6-2023-78943d9829087d93e9681426ca0c8ae2">is slowing</a>. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-business-prices-jerome-powell-government-and-politics-9e7fed8f82ffbe9af205ec969e6277af">has frequently pointed</a> to fast-rising worker pay to explain why the Fed has had to raise interest rates so aggressively. Fed rate hikes, if carried out far enough and long enough, can weaken the economy so much as to trigger a recession.</p><p>On Thursday, the government is expected to issue another mild report on inflation, which would boost hopes that the Fed might decide to pause its rate hikes sooner than has been expected. In the meantime, the job market — the most important pillar of the economy — remains remarkably sturdy.</p><p>These trends are raising expectations that the Fed might manage to engineer <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-jerome-powell-alan-blinder-economy-inflation-7dfbb4006575d0cc9920bbc1103154d1">an often-elusive “soft landing,"</a> whereby the economy slows but doesn't go into reverse and unemployment rate rises slightly but stays low. It would still mean painful times for many people. But it wouldn't inflict the widespread unemployment that typically results from a recession. </p><div id="afs:Card:386669778972" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="728bf4d2efd02b20de28db3e01ed25ba">Hub peek embed (Inflation) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“All the signs are pointing to a higher, not a lower, probability of a soft landing," said Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist who formerly served as vice chair of the Fed. “It may still not be more than 50-50. But 50-50 is looking better than it was a few months ago.”</p><p>The most positive sign, Blinder said, is the ongoing slowdown in inflation. It has dropped from a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-ap-news-alert-f3b7b00f232b7c3d6ea9bf2f605c5d9d">peak of 9.1% in June</a> to a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-november-report-c3764250d475b1149d344462adff53d6">still-high 7.1% in November</a>. When the government issues the December inflation report Thursday, economists predict it will show another step down, to 6.5%. On a monthly basis, prices are expected to have remained flat from November to December — another encouraging sign. </p><p>The inflation slowdown stems from a range of factors, including <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-prices-5f010ed0b66fb71e8d46040419a70203">cheaper gas</a>, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-health-china-business-united-states-8d5fffd96a46d0690d843f5e1de410fe">unraveling of supply chain snarls</a> and smaller profit margins among many retailers. </p><p>The national average price of a gallon of gas was $3.27 on Wednesday, far below the $5 peak in mid-June. Average used car prices, which skyrocketed 37% in 2021, have dropped for five straight months. They're now 3% cheaper than they were a year ago. Clothing prices have declined in two of the past three months. Furniture prices have dropped for three straight months. </p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-business-consumer-products-and-services-164db0f7a76020f27c176b1b21e23608">consumers are spending less</a>, forcing many retailers to cut prices to pare their inventories of goods. Online prices have fallen for four straight months from year-ago levels, according to Adobe Analytics, particularly for computers, toys and sporting goods. </p><p>“The sooner the inflation rate falls," Blinder said, “the sooner the Fed will ease up, and therefore the less the chance of a recession.” </p><p>All that said, there are plenty of threats to a soft landing. As China's economy reopens from its COVID-19 lockdowns, it may start to absorb more of the world's oil supply. That could send U.S. gas prices up again. </p><p>And while layoffs remain historically low outside of technology companies, that trend could reverse if businesses become anxious again about the economic outlook. Congress may also struggle <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-united-states-government-us-department-of-the-treasury-business-84ef9d1c5803bd25e8e9cc3538cd0ab2">to raise the debt ceiling by this summer</a>, which could cause economic turmoil, or a deep recession if they fail to do so. </p><p>But for now, a soft-landing scenario is beginning to play out. The slowdown in price increases suggests that the Fed's seven rate hikes last year have had some effect, though with inflation still well above their 2% target, the officials have made clear they expect to raise their key rate by at least three-quarters of a point more.</p><p>Even as the central bank has jacked up its benchmark rate at the fastest pace in four decades, the economy has kept growing and businesses have kept hiring. In December, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-jobs-report-jan6-2023-78943d9829087d93e9681426ca0c8ae2">employers added a solid 223,000 jobs</a>, and the unemployment rate dropped back to 3.5%, matching a 53-year low.</p><p>“The job market data is very supportive of the idea that the economy can... slow without recession,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. </p><p>There are signs of progress in the three areas Powell has identified as the key drivers of inflation: Cars, furniture and other physical goods; housing and rents; and travel, medical care, restaurant meals and other services.</p><p>Goods prices have fallen as shipping snarls during the pandemic have unraveled. And while rental and housing costs are still contributing to inflation, there is good news there as well: Private measures show that rents for new apartment leases are now rising much more slowly. That slowdown should feed into official rent measures as soon as this summer. </p><p>Powell has focused, in particular, on the inflation threat from accelerating wages. Restaurants, retailers, hotels and doctor's offices have had to substantially raise pay to attract and keep workers. </p><p>But even there, some signs indicate that inflation could keep waning. The December jobs report showed that wages increased 4.6% from a year ago, slower than the peak of 5.6% last spring. The Fed hopes to slow the pace of the wage increases so they are consistent with lower inflation. Milder inflation can help stretch paychecks further.</p><p>A wage tracker compiled by the job listings website Indeed is also showing deceleration: Wages advertised in job postings fell in December for a ninth straight month. </p><p>The wage slowdown has been even more pronounced in many services industries. Average hourly pay for workers in the leisure and hospitality sector, which includes restaurants, hotels and entertainment companies, grew by a healthy 6.4% last year. Yet that's only about half its growth rate in 2021. Average pay for retail workers has also declined. </p><p>“We're already well past the peak in monthly wage increases,” said Claudia Sahm, a former Fed economist and founder of Sahm Consulting. </p><p>Sahm also noted that rising wages don't always translate into higher prices. While many companies pass on the cost of higher pay to customers by charging more, they can also make their workers more efficient or find other savings to offset higher pay. </p><p>Even if modest hiring continues, it doesn't mean wages will keep rising as fast as they have been. </p><p>Ron Hetrick, senior economist at Lightcast, a data analytics firm, noted that strong wage gains typically occur after a shock has hit the job market. An example was the swift reopening of the economy that followed the eruption of the pandemic in early 2020. Millions of employers tried to staff up at once. </p><p>Once that period passes, Hetrick said, companies can adjust. Even if unemployment remain low, employers don't have to perpetually pay ever-higher wages to fill jobs. They can try to automate some jobs, for example. That's what many companies in Japan, where unemployment has been low for years, have done. </p><p>“You do see some signs that there’s a little less frantic-ness to hire,” Hetrick said. </p><p>The number of temp workers has declined for five straight months. And the length of the average workweek fell in December. Both signs indicate that companies are less desperate for labor. </p><p>The fact that many employers have shortened workweeks rather than cut jobs also suggests that they want to retain their employees even as the economy slows. With so many businesses having struggled to hire workers in the past two years, businesses are now more reluctant to let them go. </p><p>“That's how you get a soft landing,” Hetrick said. “By asking the workers that you have to not produce as much. But that doesn't mean you get rid of them."</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Kin Cheung, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>LONDON (AP) — In public, they present a united front — always. But Prince Harry has a very different story to tell about the British royals and the way they operate.</p><p>Harry’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/prince-harry-spare-book-revelations-0f60db708cfc266e247c1efa7c98877b">explosive memoir</a>, with its damning allegations of a toxic relationship between the monarchy and the press, could accelerate the pace of change already under way within the House of Windsor following <a href="https://apnews.com/article/queen-elizabeth-ii-remembrance-8013aa054b8d3dc0dbda80ebda2cea41">the death of Queen Elizabeth II</a>.</p><p>Harry’s description of royals leaking unflattering information about other members of the family in exchange for positive coverage of themselves is but one of the more tawdry allegations in his book, “ <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Spare-Prince-Harry-Duke-Sussex/dp/0593593804">Spare</a>,” published this week. The prince singled out King Charles III’s wife, Camilla, accusing her of feeding private conversations to the media as she sought to rehabilitate her image after her longtime affair with Charles when he was heir to the throne.</p><p>Far from the unity that is presented in public, the royal family and their staffs are depicted as scheming rivals, ready to stab each other in the back to make themselves or their bosses look better in the public eye. The palace that Harry describes resembles a modern version of the court of King Henry VIII, where courtiers jockeyed for the monarch’s favor and some lost their heads.</p><div id="afs:Card:930858951867" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="5d026ebc3feef3e2195f4c0a929f1dba">Hub peek embed (QueenElizabethII) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>The book leaves the impression of a deeply dysfunctional British royal family whose members are so concerned about the tabloid press that they are forced to make deals with journalists, says Ed Owens, author of “ <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Family-Firm-Monarchy-Historical-Perspectives/dp/1909646946">The Family Firm: Monarchy, Mass Media and the British Public, 1932-53</a>.” And the public, when faced with this proposition, may think twice.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“I think there needs to be some kind of reset, and we need to think carefully about what the monarchy is, what role it plays in society,’’ says Owens, a historian. “Because this idea of `we, the British taxpayers, pay and in return they perform' — it’s really a broken and corrupting kind of equation.”</p><p>Largely funded by taxpayers, the monarchy plays a mostly ceremonial role in British society these days — masters of soft power. But supporters argue that the institution still serves a vital role, uniting the country behind shared history and traditions embodied in both the grandeur of royal ceremonies and the day-to-day work of royals as they open schools and hospitals and hand out honors to those who serve the nation. </p><p>News coverage of the royal family generally falls into one of two categories: carefully orchestrated public appearances or sometimes chaotic stories about the private lives of royals based on unidentified sources.</p><p>But change may be at hand.</p><p>The history of colonialism — <a href="https://apnews.com/article/king-charles-iii-africa-caribbean-slavery-50f9175b541f307adb2e494fcccc80f5">so deeply intertwined with the crown</a> — is being re-examined around the world. Protesters have torn down or defaced statues in British cities, and internationally respected universities such as Oxford and Cambridge are changing their course offerings. It all adds up to one thing: An institution that was once the symbol of the British Empire is facing scrutiny as never before.</p><p>Charles, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/king-charles-III-british-throne-ab21181c92dbb154a29bad12075662e9">who became king after the death of Queen Elizabeth II</a> in September, faces the challenge of modernizing Britain’s 1,000-year-old monarchy to guarantee its survival. He has already said he plans to reduce the number of working royals and reduce the cost of the monarchy. </p><p>This has been a long time coming, perhaps, but was delayed by one key factor: Elizabeth herself. </p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/queen-elizabeth-ii-king-charles-iii-united-kingdom-royalty-9bccf9ca87374ea34ee53529cacd6052">Personal affection for the queen</a> meant that the monarchy’s role in British society was rarely debated during her seven decades on the throne. Now that she’s gone, the royal family is confronting questions about its relevance in a modern, multicultural nation that looks very different than when Elizabeth ascended the throne in 1952.</p><p>In Elizabeth’s world — governed by the mantra “never complain, never explain" — the sort of personal revelations in Harry’s book would have been unthinkable. He describes his mental health struggles following the 1997 car accident that killed his mother, Princess Diana, He recounts a physical altercation with his older brother, Prince William, reveals how he lost his virginity and describes using cocaine and cannabis.</p><p>“Spare” is the latest effort by Harry and his wife, Meghan, to tell their own story after they quit royal life and moved to California in 2020, citing what they saw as the media’s racist treatment of Meghan and a lack of support from the palace.</p><p>In the ghostwritten memoir, Harry, 38, alleges that Camilla forged connections with the British press and traded information on her way to becoming queen consort, essentially feeding unflattering stories on Harry and Meghan to the press in exchange for better coverage of herself.</p><p>The allegations are particularly sensitive because of Camilla’s role in the acrimonious breakdown of Charles’ marriage to Diana. While many members of the public initially shunned Camilla, she has won fans by taking on a wide range of charitable activities and has been credited with helping Charles appear less stuffy and more in tune with modern Britain. </p><p>Daily Mail columnist Stephen Glover leapt to her defense, arguing that Harry was just thin-skinned.</p><p>“I daresay some members of the royal family have passed stories to the press through their courtiers over the years, but it is absurd and naïve to infer that this was part of an orchestrated attempt to destabilize Harry and Meghan,’’ he wrote. “Royals are not puppets of the press, since — if they have any sense — they realize they can be biffed as well as praised. The wise ones know how to take the rough with the smooth.’’</p><p>But unlike Elizabeth, who famously issued a statement suggesting that “some recollections may vary’’ when confronted with racism allegations after <a href="https://apnews.com/article/meghan-harry-oprah-winfrey-interview-cbs-ce164e29339b948dca115c3038535bf3">Meghan’s interview with Oprah Winfrey</a> in 2021, Buckingham Palace has responded to the first major crisis of Charles’ reign with silence.</p><p>That has left Harry to dominate the headlines on both sides of the Atlantic, apparently being served tequila on a late night U.S. television show and repeatedly talking about the House of Windsor’s dirty laundry.</p><p>Since this isn’t the first scandal to rock Buckingham Palace —among other sensations, Elizabeth’s uncle abdicated the throne to marry a divorced American — many of those who bought Harry’s book on Tuesday seemed certain the institution would weather the storm.</p><p>“They just have to shrug it off and carry on being the royal family,” James Bradley, 61, said as he bought a copy. “After the queen’s death, the royal family’s stock has never been higher in my lifetime, and this will just bounce off. In six months’ time we won’t be talking about this.”</p><p>But Steven Barnett, a professor of communications at the University of Westminster, expects Harry’s revelations to push the palace to be more transparent— perhaps more like other institutions such the White House or the British prime minister’s office at 10 Downing Street.</p><p>“He’s done us a favor in exposing the collusive nature, the conspiratorial nature of relationships between the royal family and the British press,’’ Barnett says. “They will have to change the way in which they do business with the press. And that’s a good thing. It’s a good thing for the monarchy and it’s a good thing for British society.’’</p><p>___</p><p>Danica Kirka, based in London for The Associated Press, covers the British royal family. </p>]]></description>

The gun owners wanted the high court to lift a federal appeals court order that had permitted the law to be in effect.</p><p>The appeals court hasn't finished its review of the case, and justices are often reluctant to weigh in under those circumstances. The justices could still consider the case and the law more generally in the future.</p><p>In a two-paragraph statement that accompanied <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/22a557_0pm1.pdf">the court's order</a>, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that the New York law at issue in the case “presents novel and serious questions.” But Alito, writing for himself and fellow conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, said they understood the court's decision not to intervene now “to reflect respect" for the appeals court's "procedures in managing its own docket, rather than expressing any view on the merits of the case.”</p><p>In a statement, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul cheered the court's action.</p><div id="afs:Card:863611047472" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="f5dc99fc3c348456beb8b9694948e18e">Hub peek embed (U.S.SupremeCourt) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>"I’m pleased that this Supreme Court order will allow us to continue enforcing the gun laws we put in place to do just that. We believe that these thoughtful, sensible regulations will help to prevent gun violence," she said. </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The law's challengers, meanwhile, underscored that their efforts would continue. In a statement, Gun Owners of America Senior Vice President Erich Pratt said that while his group had “hoped for immediate relief" they found Alito's statement “incredibly reassuring” and “look forward to continuing the fight against New York's draconian law.”</p><p>New York lawmakers rewrote the state’s handgun laws over the summer after a June <a href="https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-guns-decision-58d01ef8bd48e816d5f8761ffa84e3e8">Supreme Court ruling</a> invalidated New York’s old system for granting permits to carry handguns outside the home. The ruling said that Americans have a right to carry firearms in public for self-defense, invalidating the New York law, which required people to show a specific need to get a license to carry a gun outside the home. The ruling was a major expansion of gun rights nationwide and resulted in challenges to other, similar state laws.</p><p>The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-york-gun-politics-legislature-kathy-hochul-38558a7dc679f01c213aea910da1ba88">new law New York passed</a> in the wake of the ruling broadly expanded who can get a license to carry a handgun, but it increased training requirements for applicants and required people seeking a license to provide more information including a list of their social media accounts. Applicants for a license must also demonstrate “good moral character.” Beyond that, the law included a long list of “sensitive places” where firearms are banned, among them: schools, playgrounds, places of worship, entertainment venues, places that serve alcohol and Times Square.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Glenn Suddaby, however, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-supreme-court-new-york-social-media-gun-politics-d2682ad7dc21aacac49b247e2a3cd518">declared multiple portions of the law unconstitutional</a> and issued a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-supreme-court-new-york-gun-politics-syracuse-kathy-hochul-42523648662363126eccf9095a0f1678">preliminary injunction</a> barring certain provisions' enforcement. For example, Suddaby blocked portions of the law requiring applicants for a concealed carry license to show “good moral character” and to hand over information about their social media accounts. He also blocked parts of the law barring guns from theaters, parks, zoos and places where alcohol is served. </p><p>His decision kept in place, however, provisions barring guns at schools and playgrounds, among other things, because of historical support for those restrictions. He also kept in place the ban on guns in Times Square.</p><p>But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit had <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-york-gun-politics-4be4aaa7e9268a6f2aba0e7e32f1300d">put Suddaby's ruling on hold</a> while it considers the case. Challengers to the law had asked the high court to step in and allow Suddaby's ruling to go into effect while the case continues. It was that request the justices declined.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Surgeons removed a cancerous lesion above first lady <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/jill-biden">Jill Biden</a> 's right eye and one on her chest, the White House said Wednesday, while a third lesion on her left eyelid was being examined.</p><p>Dr. Kevin O’Connor, the physician to President Joe Biden, said examinations showed that the lesion over Jill Biden's right eye and one newly discovered on her chest were both confirmed to be <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000824.htm">basal cell carcinoma</a>. The lesion on her left eyelid was “fully excised, with margins, and was sent for standard microscopic examination,” according to <a href="https://twitter.com/vvaldivia46/status/1613282241576308736/photo/1">O'Connor's report</a>.</p><p>Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer, but also the most curable form. It's considered highly treatable, especially when caught early. It is a slow-growing cancer that usually is confined to the surface of skin — doctors almost always can remove it all with a shallow incision — and seldom causes serious complications or becomes life-threatening.</p><p>The Bidens spent the day at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, where the 71-year-old first lady underwent a common outpatient procedure known as <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007634.htm">Mohs surgery</a> to remove and examine the lesions. After nearly nine hours at the hospital, the president returned to the White House solo; the first lady was expected to follow later in the evening.</p><div id="afs:Card:029281580227" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="545cac7c3ddca1f095e84383fdf8cd2d">Hub peek embed (apf-Health) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>O'Connor said she was “experiencing some facial swelling and bruising, but was "in good spirits and is feeling well." </p><p>Basal cell carcinoma is so common there aren’t good counts. The <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/basal-and-squamous-cell-skin-cancer/about/key-statistics.html">American Cancer Society</a> lumps them in with another easily treated type called squamous cell cancers. About 3.3 million Americans get one of those two types each year and the vast majority are basal cell, according to the organization.</p><p>The first lady's office announced a week ago, through a Jan. 4 memo from O'Connor, that doctors had discovered <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-health-jill-skin-cancer-acef4be533b13db9c2ff61bed8be2063">the lesion above her right eye</a> during a recent routine skin cancer screening. The lesions removed from her chest and left eyelid were discovered on Wednesday.</p><p>The Mohs surgery involves cutting away thin layers of skin and examining each layer for signs of cancer. Doctors keep removing and examining layers of skin until there are no signs of cancer. </p><p>Doctors recommended removing the lesion from above Jill Biden's right eye “in an abundance of caution,” O'Connor wrote in the memo.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.skincancer.org/blog/first-lady-jill-biden-undergoes-mohs-surgery/">Skin Cancer Foundation</a> said the delicate skin around the eyes is especially vulnerable to damage from the sun's ultraviolet rays. Sun exposure is the main risk for basal cell carcinoma.</p><p>Jill Biden had the procedure the morning after she and the president returned from Mexico City, where he held <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-canada-government-mexico-d6f622d986bc07fae93fa4c53bfaaef9">two days of talks</a> with the leaders of Mexico and Canada, and she kept a separate schedule of meetings with women, children and her counterparts from both countries.</p><p>Biden accompanied the first lady to the hospital, as he has done for some of her past medical appointments since he became president. </p><p>“Today is about his wife, that is the focus for the president right now,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said when asked about Biden's activities at the hospital while doctors cared for the first lady. “This is about the president supporting his wife of 45 years.”</p><p>Biden accompanied his wife to an outpatient center near the campus of George Washington University in April 2021 for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-jill-biden-afghanistan-33ff0650979b8c575128a8408eacbf1e">a medical procedure</a> the White House described only as “common.” </p><p>He also went with her to Walter Reed in July 2021 for outpatient treatment after she <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2020-tokyo-olympics-sports-joe-biden-health-hawaii-51a60bd0eb961d204e7373eeeec8b275">punctured her left foot</a> while walking on a beach in Hawaii. She had stopped there on her way back to Washington from the Tokyo Olympics.</p><p>___</p><p>AP Medical Writer Lauran Neergaard and AP White House Correspondent Zeke Miller contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

(Jan. 11)</p>    <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Thousands of flights across the U.S. were canceled or delayed Wednesday after a government system that offers safety and other information to pilots broke down, stranding some planes on the ground for hours.</p><p>The White House said there was no evidence that a cyberattack triggered the outage, which upended travel plans for millions of passengers. President Joe Biden said he directed the Department of Transportation to investigate.</p><div id="fe866060-7820-11ed-be6b-9bcdd270dc61" class="related-story-embed"></div><p>The breakdown showed how much American air travel depends on an antiquated computer system that generates alerts called NOTAMs — or Notice to Air Missions — to pilots and others.</p><p>Before a flight takes off, pilots and airline dispatchers must review the notices, which include details about weather, runway closures or construction and other information that could affect the flight. The system was once telephone-based, with pilots calling dedicated flight service stations for the information, but it has moved online.</p><p>The NOTAM system broke down late Tuesday and was not fixed until midmorning Wednesday, leading to more than 1,200 flight cancellations and more than 8,500 delays by early afternoon on the East Coast, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware.</p><p>Even after the Federal Aviation Administration lifted the order grounding planes, the chaos was expected to linger. More than 21,000 flights were scheduled to take off Wednesday in the U.S., mostly domestic trips, and about 1,840 international flights expected to fly to the U.S., according to aviation data firm Cirium.</p><p>Airports in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Atlanta saw 30% to 40% of flights delayed.</p><p>“There was a systems issue overnight that led to a ground stop because of the way safety information was moving through the system,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told a news conference. Although the problem was soon fixed, he warned that travelers could expect to see some effects "rippling through the system.”</p><p>Buttigieg said his agency would now try to learn why the NOTAM system went down.</p><p>Longtime aviation insiders could not recall an outage of such magnitude caused by a technology breakdown. Some compared it to the nationwide shutdown of airspace after the 2001 terrorist attacks.</p><div class="social-embed" id="se1:d564b6e0-7820-11ed-9cae-f5ff69d5d8cf"><div style="position:relative; overflow:hidden; padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://cdn.jwplayer.com/players/d2YlmM77-BZDlaZqP.html" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="auto" title="Biden: 'We don't know' what caused flight stoppage" style="position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></div><p class="social-caption"> </p></div><p>“Periodically there have been local issues here or there, but this is pretty significant historically,” said Tim Campbell, a former senior vice president of air operations at American Airlines and now a consultant in Minneapolis.</p><p>Campbell said there has long been concern about the FAA's technology, and not just the NOTAM system.</p><p>Many of those systems "are old mainframe systems that are generally reliable, but they are out of date,” he said.</p><p>John Cox, a former airline pilot and aviation safety expert, said there has been talk in the aviation industry for years about trying to modernize the NOTAM system, but he did not know the age of the servers that the FAA uses.</p><p>“I’ve been flying 53 years. I’ve never heard the system go down like this,” Cox said. “So something unusual happened.”</p><p>According to FAA advisories, the NOTAM system failed at 8:28 p.m. Tuesday, preventing new or amended notices from being distributed to pilots. The FAA resorted to a telephone hotline to keep departures flying overnight, but as daytime traffic picked up, the phone system became overwhelmed.</p><p>The FAA ordered all departing flights grounded early Wednesday morning, affecting all passenger and cargo flights. Some medical flights could get clearance, and the outage did not affect any military operations.</p><p>Biden said that he was briefed by Buttigieg.</p><p>Buttigieg emphasized that "safety is going to be our North Star, as it always is.”</p><p>“We are now pivoting to focus on understanding the causes of the issue,” he said.</p><p>Passengers scrambled to rearrange trips. Many said they had trouble finding out how long the delays would last.</p><p>“There is just a lot of frustration, a lot of confusion," said Ryan Ososki, who was trying to fly from Washington, D.C., to California for a conference. “I’m back to an hour and a half delayed (and) still unclear as to whether or not I should be boarding because I’d now miss my connection flight.”</p><p>Julia Macpherson was on a United flight from Sydney to Los Angeles when she learned of possible delays.</p><p>“As I was up in the air, I got news from my friend who was also traveling overseas that there was a power outage,” said Macpherson, who was returning to Florida from Hobart, Tasmania.</p><p>Once she lands in Los Angeles, she still has a connection in Denver on her way to Jacksonville, Florida.</p><p>She said there were no announcements on the flight about the FAA issue.</p><p>Similar stories came out of Chicago, Washington, Atlanta and other major U.S. airports. </p><p>European flights into the U.S. appeared to be largely unaffected. Carriers including Ireland's Aer Lingus and Germany's Lufthansa said their schedules were unaffected.</p><p>It was the latest headache for travelers in the U.S. who faced weather-related flight cancellations over the holidays and a broad breakdown at Southwest Airlines.</p><p>Passengers also ran into long lines, lost baggage, and cancellations and delays over the summer as travel demand roared back from the COVID-19 pandemic and ran into staffing cutbacks at airports and airlines in the U.S. and Europe.</p><div class="social-embed" id="se2:75066bc0-7820-11ed-8450-65674fa033b8"><iframe title="FAA system outage causes widespread cancellations" aria-label="Column Chart" id="ap-chart-oUUBs" src="https://interactives.ap.org/embeds/oUUBs/13/" scrolling="no" width="100%" style="border:none" height="400" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe><p class="social-caption"> </p></div><p>___</p><p>Koenig reported from Dallas.

Some of it aimed to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-consumer-electronics-show-las-vegas-business-636992098ae9b734356ce5eea794f715">make your life more fun</a>. And some of it was just a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-consumer-electronics-show-electric-boats-5a66f29d0b446d6c51c9802dbd96beca">little out there</a>.</p><p>Associated Press journalists spent last week combing cavernous exhibit halls for the most exciting, interesting and unusual tech innovations.</p><p>Here's what caught our eye:</p><p>MOST FUN WAY TO GET TO WORK</p><p>Journalists had fun zipping around the CES Unveiled event on remote-controlled, electric inline skates from French startup AtmosGear.</p><p>The battery lasts for 20 miles (32 kilometers), said founder Mohamed Soliman, who hopes people will see them as a viable way to commute, like electric bikes or scooters.</p><p>“My goal is for everyone to go skating again because it’s so much fun, every time you see people skating you see them with a big smile,” Soliman said.</p><p>A waist bag holds the battery and cables connected to the skates. They also can be used as regular skates when they need to be charged or skaters simply want to travel under their own power.</p><p>The $500 skates are available for pre-order. The company has taken orders for 150 pairs so far and is aiming for 200 orders to start production.</p><div id="afs:Card:710305756722" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="99bb43f07235150707ee52d4af1b0409">Hub peek embed (apf-technology) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>TECH TO BRING TO A PARTY</p><p>A handheld device displayed by South Korean company Prinker allows you to quickly and easily apply temporary tattoos.</p><p>The device uses cosmetic-grade ink with a library of thousands of designs or the option to make your own with the company’s app. After picking a tattoo, you just wave the device over wherever you want it applied. The tattoos are waterproof but wash off with soap.</p><p>The flagship model is $279 and a smaller model is $229. Ink cartridges good for 1,000 tattoos are $119.</p><p>There's also an accessory to temporarily color your hair.</p><p>KITCHEN TECH WE'RE COVETING</p><p>GE Profile unveiled a smart mixer that lets you weigh your ingredients in the bowl while you’re working.</p><p>The mixer also has an auto sensor that can monitor changes in texture and viscosity and adjust speed accordingly. It shuts itself off automatically to avoid overmixing. </p><p>And it has voice control so you don’t have to stop what you’re doing and wash your hands off to operate it.</p><p>All that precision doesn’t come cheap — the mixer costs $999.95 and is only available at Crate &amp; Barrel.</p><p>TECH TO BUY YOUR PARENTS</p><p>Bird Buddy showed off a smart bird feeder that takes snapshots of feathered friends as they fly in to eat some treats. The startup says its AI technology can recognize more than 1,000 species of birds, allowing users to share through a mobile app what kind of birds they’re feeding.</p><p>“We try to kind of gamify the collection so it’s a really fun game that you can play — almost like a real life <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/?hl=en">Pokémon Go</a> with real animals and wildlife in your backyard,” said Kyle Buzzard, the company’s co-founder and chief hardware officer.</p><p>The product has already sparked some interest from consumers who want to show the world what birds are coming into their backyards. </p><p>The company, which began as a Kickstarter project in 2020, says it started shipping its bird feeders in September and has already sold all 100,000 in its inventory. The price for the basic feeder is $199.</p><p>TECH TO BUY YOUR KIDS</p><p>Meet Dog-E, the excitable robodog.</p><p>Unveiled by toy maker WowWee, Dog-E has more than a million possible combinations of lights, sounds and personality traits.</p><p>Dog-E begins as a blank canvas and develops its personality as you set it up.</p><p>The app-connected toy has audio sensors to hear sounds, touch sensors on its sides and body, and a tail that you can program to display lighted icons and messages when it wags.</p><p>Jessica Kalichman from WowWee says it’s a good option for those who can’t commit to owning a real pup, or perhaps for those with allergies.</p><p>“I do think for anyone that’s either not ready to have a dog yet, this is a great test to take care of it, learn to feed it, nurture it, and really have that trial run for a family,” she said.</p><p>WowWee expects to have Dog-E in stores in September. It will sell for $79. The app to control the toy’s movements does not require a subscription.</p><p>TECH FOR GOOD</p><p>Knowing exactly when an avocado is perfectly ripe may sound a bit niche, but Dutch startup OneThird thinks it’s a key to helping reduce food waste.</p><p>The company unveiled an avocado scanner designed for supermarkets that’s currently being tested in Canada and can tell you whether an avocado is still firm or ready to eat.</p><p>OneThird already works with growers, distributors and others along the supply chain to predict the shelf life of avocados, tomatoes, strawberries and blueberries and is working to add more produce.</p><p>According to the United Nations, nearly a third of food of all food globally is thrown away. Reducing that would mean less food waste being tossed into methane-producing landfills.</p><p>TECH FOR PETS</p><p>Have you ever wondered what your dog would say if it could speak to you?</p><p>FluentPet promises the next best thing — buttons the company says you can train your pet to push if it’s hungry, needs to go outside or wants to play.</p><p>The buttons come in a hexagon-shaped plastic mat called a hextile. Hextiles can be connected to each other to form a bigger collection of buttons.</p><p>“We find that actually when dogs kind of know that they’re being understood because they have the precision and specificity of the buttons, then they complain less because they’re no longer wondering whether they actually communicated what they wanted to,” said Leo Trottier, FluentPet CEO.</p><p>At CES, the company announced FluentPet Connect, a new app that notifies owners when their dog presses a button and collects data on how the buttons are used.</p><p>Fluent Pet’s starter kit comes with hextiles, a speaker and six buttons for $159.95. The app does not require a subscription.</p><p>TECH TO MAKE YOUR NEXT CONFERENCE CALL MORE EXCITING</p><p>Tired of the same old videoconference calls? Zero Distance thinks it may have the answer.</p><p>The company’s Wehead device helps people at a meeting feel like a remote attendee is in the room with them.</p><p>The device looks something like a machine you might find at the eye doctor, but with screens on the front. The person participating from afar looks like they’re there in 3D and when they look around or nod, the machine also moves.</p><p>Wehead works with standard computer or smartphone webcams.</p><p>“If there are a few people around the table and just one screen, not everybody can see the screen, and the person in the laptop, he or she is not able to see everybody,” Wehead creator Ilia Sedoshkin said. “That’s the obvious application.”</p><p>“But for people who spend like 40 hours a week in their home office, they don’t see other people a lot. So feeling the real person in the room, using some space on your table, can give you less loneliness,” Sedoshkin said.</p><p>The Wehead costs $1,555, with a pro version available for $4,555.</p><p>INNOVATION WE MOST WANTED TO TAKE HOME</p><p>Japan’s Yukai Engineering says its robotic fufuly pillow can help users relax by mimicking the rhythm of breathing.</p><p>The soft, fluffy pillow gently expands and contracts, vibrating as you hold it against your stomach. The idea is that you’ll breathe more slowly and deeply as your breath starts to synch with the movement of the pillow.</p><p>It was developed based on research done at the University of Tokyo.</p><p>Yukai CEO Shunsuke Aoki said the pillow can help remote workers who struggle to switch off from their jobs. </p><p>The version on display at CES is a prototype. The company is looking for partners and hopes to start producing it this year.</p><p>BEST CELEBRITY APPEARANCE</p><p>Singer and dancer Paula Abdul came to CES to launch Idol Eyes, a line of audio sunglasses.</p><p>“I’ve wanted to get into the tech world for the longest time,” Abdul told The Associated Press, “but I wanted to do it in a way that was authentic to who I am.”</p><p>Starting at $199, the sunglasses feature a five-hour battery life and play audio from the arms of the frames via Bluetooth connectivity. You can listen to music or answer calls.</p><p>The Grammy- and Emmy-award winning artist’s first collection of eyewear is available in seven colors, with polarized and blue light filter lenses.</p><p>“I’m just marrying fashion, movement and technology,” Abdul said. “That’s where my heart is.”</p><p>___</p><p>Read more about CES: <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/technology">https://apnews.com/hub/technology</a></p>]]></description>

(Jan 10)(AP video by Terry Chea)</p>    <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) — Storm-ravaged California scrambled to clean up and repair widespread damage on Wednesday as the lashing rain eased in many areas, although thunderstorms led a new <a href="https://apnews.com/article/4032ebd7e5e04800b44c35241b66a6a7">atmospheric river</a> into the northern half of the state.</p><p>The plume of moisture lurking off the coast stretched all the way over the Pacific to Hawaii, making it “a true Pineapple Express,” the National Weather Service said.</p><p>The latest rains were expected to impact only Northern California, giving the south a break until more wet weather arrives by the weekend.</p><p>At least 17 people have died in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/floods-weather-natural-disasters-landslides-and-mudslides-storms-21b103e791710f4af6ca0ce45c6030b5">the storms battering the state</a>. The figure is likely to rise, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday during a visit to the scenic town of Capitola on the Santa Cruz coast that was hard hit by high surf and flooding creek waters last week.</p><p>A 43-year-old woman who called 911 and said her car was stuck in floodwaters Tuesday was found dead a day later inside the submerged vehicle north of San Francisco, according to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sonoma.sheriff/posts/pfbid0EUopLZweo6aLz38eLT2PHomYTgq7NnUUfyTRp9WwGHKJ5rjtCLbcHXpwnYuwxynKl">Sonoma County Sheriff's Office</a>. When the search resumed at sunrise Wednesday, divers discovered the car under about 10 feet (3 meters) of water off a rural road near Forestville, the department said. </p><p>To the south in the central part of the state, a pickup truck driver and a motorcyclist were killed Tuesday in the San Joaquin Valley when a tree that had been struck by lightning fell on them, authorities said.</p><div id="afs:Card:722724375005" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="fd81a7f8760436fcaa673549e4461486">Hub peek embed (Weather) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>More than half of California’s 58 counties were declared disaster areas, the governor said.</p><p>The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-flooding-Montecito-evacuation-order-7c151eeaf3f567a125d74245173327f1">previous storm that began Monday</a> was one in <a href="https://apnews.com/b83bb05fa2d21796a85be9bfc690cf17">a series that began late last month</a> and repairing the damage may cost more than $1 billion, said Adam Smith, a disaster expert with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Los Angeles Times reported.</p><p>California Department of Transportation snowplows high in the Eastern Sierra were running around the clock to fully reopen U.S. 395, which at one time was blocked by 75 miles (121 kilometers) of snow, ice and rocks. The Palisades Tahoe ski resort reported that it had received 300 inches (7.6 meters) of snowfall so far this season.</p><p>Crews worked to clear other major highways that were closed by rockslides, swamped by flooding or smothered with mud while more than 10,000 people who were ordered out of seaside towns on the central coast were allowed to return home.</p><div id="ba93919a84514b998b789a94e310e3f3" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>That included Montecito, a wealthy Santa Barbara County community that is home to Prince Harry and other celebrities where 23 people died and more than 100 homes were destroyed in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/3fff145e651f4a81b1cf71177153c337">a mudslide five years ago</a>.</p><p>Yet thousands of people living near rain-swollen creeks and rivers remained under evacuation orders. In the San Joaquin Valley, raging waters from Bear Creek flooded parts of the city of Merced and neighboring Planada, a small agricultural community along a highway leading to Yosemite National Park.</p><p>All 4,000 residents of Planada were ordered to leave Tuesday morning. Neighborhoods were under water with cars submerged up to their roofs. Residents ordered to evacuate carried whatever they could salvage on their backs as they left in the rain. </p><p>Other evacuations were ordered because of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/floods-california-state-government-dam-and-levee-breaches-sacramento-5dc0617f489dfc22039c5d29b2d28362">levee breaches</a> in parts of Monterey County.</p><p>Despite the rain, most of the state <a href="https://apnews.com/article/science-weather-california-droughts-storms-04a759ff7f9db227d226ce098ad62b6d">remained in extreme or severe drought</a>, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.</p><p>The storms may help locally “but will not resolve the long-term drought challenges,” said Rick Spinrad, administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p><p>Damage from the storm included washed-out roads and seaside businesses flooded by 20-foot (6-meter) surf that pounded Santa Cruz County.</p><p>A line of thunderstorms moving into the Sierra foothills produced a tornado with winds up to 90 mph (145 kph) that tore up trees for about a half-mile before dawn Tuesday in rural Calaveras County, 85 miles (137 km) east of San Francisco. A few minutes earlier, gusts estimated at 75 mph (121 kph) lifted a large horse barn over a fence, damaged trees and other barn roofs, the Sacramento National Weather Service office said.</p><p>Many areas saw unprecedented amounts of rain coupled with furious winds and even hail and lightning that knocked down trees and damaged electrical lines.</p><p>More than 54,000 homes and businesses around the state were without power as of Wednesday afternoon, according to the website <a href="https://poweroutage.us/">Poweroutage.us.</a></p><p>Mudslides damaged some homes in pricey Los Angeles hillside areas, while further up the coast a sinkhole damaged 15 homes in the rural Santa Barbara County community of Orcutt.</p><p>Kevin Costner, best-actor winner in a television drama series for “Yellowstone,” was unable to attend Tuesday’s Golden Globe awards in Los Angeles because of the weather. Presenter Regina Hall said he was sheltering in place in Santa Barbara due to flooding.</p><p>In San Francisco, a tree fell on a commuter bus on Tuesday without causing injuries and lightning struck the city’s iconic Transamerica Pyramid building without damage. High winds also ripped away part of the roof on a large apartment building.</p><p>Some people found themselves stranded in small communities inundated with water and mud.</p><p>“We’re all stuck out here,” Brian Briggs said, describing a scary night during which the deluge unleashed mudslides in remote Matilija Canyon that buried one house and cut off the only road to nearby Ojai. The canyon creek began to flood yards and the surrounding hills, which were stripped of vegetation in the 2017 Thomas Fire, began to tumble down in the dark.</p><p>Mudflows dragged sheds, gazebos and outhouses into the creek, Briggs said. After helping neighbors get to higher ground, he returned home to find his fence destroyed by waist-deep mud.</p><p>A helicopter dropped 10 sheriff’s deputies Tuesday to help the residents of dozens of canyon homes.</p><p>The wet and blustery weather left California’s large homeless population in a precarious situation. At least two homeless people in Sacramento County died and more than a dozen people were rescued from a homeless encampment on the Ventura River.</p><p>Theo Harris, who has lived on San Francisco's streets since 2016, fortified his shelter with tarps and zip ties Tuesday and took in his girlfriend after her tent flooded.</p><p>“The wind has been treacherous, but you just got to bundle up and make sure you stay dry,” Harris said. “Rain is part of life. It’s going to be sunny. It’s going to rain. I just got to strap my boots up and not give up.”</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press journalists John Antczak and Stefanie Dazio in Los Angeles and Janie Har and Olga R.

(AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The fate of a devastated salt-mining town in eastern Ukraine hung in the balance Wednesday in one of the bloodiest battles of Russia's invasion, while Ukraine's unflagging resistance and other challenges prompted Moscow to shake up its military leadership again.</p><p>Russian forces used jets, mortars and rockets to bombard Soledar in an unrelenting assault. </p><p>Soledar's fall, while unlikely a turning point in the nearly 11-month war, would be a prize for a Kremlin starved of good battlefield news in recent months. It would also offer Russian troops a springboard to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-russia-ukraine-war-donetsk-moscow-1643b607f7424aa58637514c59e22b35">conquer other areas</a> of Donetsk province that remain under Ukrainian control, such as the nearby strategic city of Bakhmut. </p><p>Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk province, which together make up the Donbas region bordering Russia, were Moscow's main stated territorial targets in invading Ukraine, but the fighting has settled mostly into a stalemate.</p><p>In an apparent recognition of battlefield setbacks, Russia's Defense Ministry announced the demotion of the head of Russian forces in Ukraine after only three months on the job. Russia's top military officer — the chief of the military’s General Staff, Gen. Valery Gerasimov — was named as the replacement for Gen. Sergei Surovikin, who was demoted to deputy. </p><div id="afs:Card:521103274690" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="9cc363adc31419311cadb3c5ed8e0601">Hub peek embed (Russia-Ukraine) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>During his short time overseeing the troops in Ukraine, Surovikin was credited with strengthening coordination, reinforcing control and introducing a campaign to knock out Ukraine's public utilities as a pressure tactic. But he also announced a humiliating withdrawal in November from Kherson, the only regional center Russian forces had captured just weeks after the Kremlin illegally annexed the area. His demotion signaled that Russian President Vladimir Putin wasn’t fully satisfied with his performance. </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Gerasimov, meanwhile, was seen as the top architect of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and critics have blamed him for Moscow’s military setbacks.</p><p>Britain's Defense Ministry said putting Gerasimov in charge is “an indicator of the increasing seriousness of the situation Russia is facing, and a clear acknowledgement that the campaign is falling short of Russia’s strategic goals.” It added in a tweet that Russian ultra-nationalists and military bloggers critical of Gerasimov are likely to greet the news with “extreme displeasure.” </p><p>The Russian Defense Ministry's formal explanation was that expanded military tasks and the need for “closer interaction between branches of the military as well as increasing the quality of supplies and the efficiency of directing groups of forces” prompted the leadership changes.</p><p>On the battlefield, a Ukrainian officer, near Soledar, told The Associated Press the pattern is that first the Russians send one or two waves of soldiers, many from the private Russian military contractor Wagner Group, who take heavy casualties as they probe the Ukrainian defenses. When Ukrainian troops suffer casualties and are exhausted, the Russians send a fresh wave of highly-trained soldiers, paratroopers or special forces, said the Ukrainian officer, who insisted on anonymity for security reasons.</p><p>Ukrainian officials denied Russian claims that Soledar had fallen but the Wagner Group's owner repeated the assertion of a breakthrough late Wednesday.</p><p>“Once again I want to confirm the complete liberation and cleansing of the territory of Soledar from units of the Ukrainian army,” Yevgeny Prigozhin wrote on his Russian social media platform. “Civilians were withdrawn. Ukrainian units that did not want to surrender were destroyed." He claimed about 500 people were killed and that "the whole city is littered with the corpses of Ukrainian soldiers.”</p><p>Ukraine’s military said late Wednesday Russian forces had suffered “huge losses” in the Soledar fighting.</p><p>The AP was unable independently to verify either side's claims. </p><p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stopped short of declaring the municipality's capture, telling reporters Russian forces had achieved “positive dynamics in advancing” in Soledar. “Let’s not rush, and wait for official statements,” he added.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy weighed in Wednesday in his nightly video address: “Now the terrorist state and its propagandists are trying to pretend that some part of our city of Soledar - a city that was almost completely destroyed by the occupiers - is allegedly some kind of Russia’s achievement.” He said Ukrainian forces in the area are holding out against the Russians. </p><p>Soledar, known for salt mining and processing, has little intrinsic value but it lies at a strategic point 10 kilometers (six miles) north of the city of Bakhmut, which Russian forces want to surround. </p><p>Taking Bakhmut would disrupt Ukraine’s supply lines and open a route for the Russians to press toward Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, Ukrainian strongholds in Donetsk province.</p><p>Soledar’s fall would make “holding Bakhmut much more precarious for Ukraine,” Michael Kofman, the director of Russia Studies at the CAN nonprofit research group in Arlington, Virginia, noted.</p><p>The war of attrition, with heavy casualties, may make a Russian victory as deadly as a defeat. </p><p>“I don’t think the outcome at Bakhmut is that significant compared to what it costs Russia to achieve it,” Kofman said in a tweet.</p><p>The Wagner Group, which now reportedly includes a large contingent of convicts recruited in Russian prisons and constitutes up to a quarter of all Russian combatants in Ukraine, has spearheaded the attack on Soledar and Bakhmut. </p><p>Delivering victory in Soledar and Bakhmut after months of Russian frontline difficulties would help Prigozhin, who has criticized Gerasimov, increase his clout in what has emerged as somewhat of a rivalry with Russia's military leadership. </p><p>Russian troops have struggled to gain control over Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and another Ukrainian province the Kremlin illegally annexed in September, after incorporating the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. When Russian forces withdrew from Kherson, the battle heated up around Bakhmut.</p><p>Putin identified the Donbas region as a focus from the war’s outset, and Moscow-backed separatists have fought there since 2014. Russia captured almost all of Luhansk during the summer. Donetsk escaped the same fate, and the Russian military subsequently poured manpower and resources around Bakhmut.</p><p>The Institute for the Study of War said Russian forces were up against “concerted Ukrainian resistance” around Bakhmut.</p><p>“The reality of block-by-block control of terrain in Soledar is obfuscated by the dynamic nature of urban combat ... and Russian forces have largely struggled to make significant tactical gains in the Soledar area for months,” the Washington-based think tank said. </p><p>An exceptional feature of the fighting near Bakhmut is that some has taken place around entrances to disused salt mine tunnels, which run for some 200 kilometers (120 miles), according to Western intelligence reports.</p><p>In other developments:</p><p>— Putin claimed Wednesday that Russia had successfully resisted Western pressure, especially sanctions, over its invasion of Ukraine and vowed that his country has enough resources to beef up its military while continuing social programs. “Nothing of what our enemies forecast has happened,” Putin said in a video call with his Cabinet. “We will strengthen our defense capability and will undoubtedly solve all issues related to supplies to military units involved in the special military operation,” he said, using the Kremlin’s euphemism for the war. Reports have circulated that Russia is struggling to produce enough weapons, equipment and clothing for its troops battling in Ukraine.</p><p>— Polish President Andrzej Duda said his country is willing to send <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-government-andrzej-duda-europe-business-77ce9801328b98b77f72b0cb6d989717">German-made Leopard tanks</a> to help Ukraine as part of a larger international coalition. Duda spoke after meeting in Lviv with Zelenskyy, who said Ukraine needs tanks to win the war. In Britain, another staunch Ukraine ally, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesman said no final decision has been made whether to send tanks. </p><p>— The Russian and Ukrainian human rights commissioners agreed to swap more than 40 military prisoners, Turkey’s state-run Anadolu Agency reported. The two warring parties have exchanged prisoners multiple times, in one of the few areas of cooperation. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said his country has proposed establishing a corridor to bring the wounded to Turkey. "This is our humanitarian duty, our duty of conscience,” he said.</p><p>___</p><p>Monika Scislowska in Warsaw, Poland, and Yuras Karmanau in Tallinn, Estonia, contributed to this story.</p><p>Follow AP’s coverage of the war at <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine">https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine</a></p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rallied Wednesday as investors locked in their final moves ahead of a highly anticipated report on inflation, one that could show whether Wall Street's rising optimism recently has been warranted or overdone. </p><p>The S&amp;P 500 climbed 1.3% for its second straight gain before Thursday morning’s inflation data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose nearly 269 points, or 0.8%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1.8%.</p><p>Stocks have started 2023 with gains on hopes that cooling inflation and a slowing economy may get the Federal Reserve to ease off its sharp hikes to interest rates. Such increases can help stamp out high inflation, but they also slow the economy by design and raise <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-business-compensation-and-benefits-economy-728bf4d2efd02b20de28db3e01ed25ba">the risk of a recession</a> while hurting prices for stocks and other investments. </p><p>Economists expect Thursday’s report to show inflation is continuing to cool from its summertime peak, down to 6.5% last month from 7.1% in November and from more than 9% in June. The hope on Wall Street is that such a trend toward normal could convince the Fed to soon halt its blistering set of rate increases, many of which were at shock-and-awe levels that were triple the usual amount.</p><p>Some investors are even betting the Fed will cut interest rates in the second half of this year, to help prop up an economy that’s beginning to show pockets of weakness because of past rate hikes. Cuts to rates typically act like steroids for markets, helping prices for stocks and other investments. </p><div id="afs:Card:386669778972" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="ea68840f36ee07f4e6688b151ad50aee">Hub peek embed (Inflation) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“One real thing I think underpinning the market is simply the fact that the market doesn’t believe the Fed when they say they’re going to keep hiking this year,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network.</p><p>Of course, that also means investors could be setting themselves up for disappointment. If Thursday’s data and other reports don’t show inflation is improving as much as expected, it could mean the Fed would have to get tougher on interest rates. </p><p>The Fed has already said repeatedly it plans to raise its key overnight interest rate further, past its current perch sitting in a range of 4.25% to 4.50%. That rate began last year at its record low of virtually zero. </p><p>The central bank has also insisted it plans to keep rates high for a while to ensure inflation is really beaten down. It does not envision any rate cuts happening this year, and it's even said that any “unwarranted” rallies on Wall Street “driven by a misperception” would only make the mission of returning inflation to normal more complicated. </p><p>Recently, though, Wall Street has been looking through such pronouncements. </p><p>Treasury yields have been easing off their recent highs, in part on expectations for an easier Fed. </p><p>The yield on the two-year Treasury, which tends to track expectations for Fed action, dipped to 4.22% from 4.24% late Tuesday. The 10-year Treasury yield, which helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans, fell to 3.53% from 3.61%. </p><p>If the economy does fall into a modest recession, possible rate cuts could offer some support for stocks. And hope is growing among investors that the economy could successfully walk the tightrope of slowing enough to snuff out high inflation but not so much as to cause a deep recession. </p><p>That's helped spark a mini-rebound for some of the stocks that fell the most last year, which plunged in large part because of rising rates. </p><p>Facebook’s parent, Meta, is up 10.4% so far in 2023 after slumping 64.2% in 2022, for example.</p><p>Later this week, companies will also begin reporting how much profit they made during the last three months of 2022. That's key because earnings are one of the main levers that set stock prices, and the reports will offer a window into how companies are managing the squeeze of inflation. </p><p>Bank of America, Delta Air Lines, JPMorgan Chase and UnitedHealth are among those reporting results on Friday. Analysts say this could mark the first time earnings per share across S&amp;P 500 companies dropped from year-ago levels since 2020. </p><p>The S&amp;P 500 gained 50.36 points to 3,969.61 Wednesday. The Dow rose 268.91 to 33,973.01, and the Nasdaq climbed 189.04 to 10,931.67.</p>]]></description>

(Jan. 11)</p>    <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) — Standout moments from the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2023-golden-globes-updates-38f7af2fc28d44729beed3c4a1527ca0">Golden Globe Awards</a>, which returned to television Tuesday night after a year's absence. </p><p>DON'T SHOOT THE PIANO PLAYER </p><p>Pianist Chloe Flower had a sweet gig at the <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/golden-globe-awards">Golden Globes</a>, playing TV and movie theme songs on camera as the show went to commercial breaks, but it turned temporarily sour when some in the viewing audience wrongly assumed she was the one deciding when annoyed <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2023-golden-globes-winners-list-a434cdd1941c10eb7fd056e4d59bd368">winners</a> had to wrap up their speeches. </p><p>“Shut up, I can beat you up,” said Michelle Yeoh, the star of many a kung fu movie, when piano music began playing her off about two minutes into her acceptance of the Globe for best actress in a musical or comedy film for “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” </p><div id="b6e06b58e32a4e8e8f5110d2030cfdd4" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>“You can forget that piano,” Colin Farrell said over the music as he accepted the male version of the same award for “The Banshees of Inisherin.” </p><p>When Austin Butler won best actor in a drama film for “Elvis” and the piano began, he pleaded for a song by the man he portrayed. </p><p>“At least play ‘Suspicious Minds’ or something,” Butler said. </p><p>But none of that was Flower. </p><p>“People on Twitter are mad like she’s playing people off, but it’s a track,” host Jerrod Carmichael said during the show. “Chloe, we are lucky to have you.”</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/chloeflower/status/1613006017595609089?s=46&amp;t=ohWWkux6SUmgO5Rd3j6_jA">Flower tweeted</a> on the topic herself mid-show. </p><div id="db99da397da9443e82b063464ccc73ee" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>“I would never play piano over people’s speeches!!" she wrote. ”I’m only playing when you see me on camera!" </p><p>MURPHY SLAPS WITH TWO MINUTES AND A MIC DROP</p><p>Eddie Murphy certainly didn't need playing off. Many who win the Cecil B. DeMille Award, a lifetime achievement prize, use the moment to make a major speech. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-tv-oprah-winfrey-north-america-golden-globe-awards-12eb36960551425f9dad41da34602039">Oprah Winfrey</a> 's in 2018 inspired calls for a presidential run. But Murphy's acceptance took just two minutes, shorter than many of the night's regular winners.</p><p>He thanked a handful of people and quickly wrapped it up with a mic-drop joke about <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-oscars-will-smith-chris-rock-confrontation-f90b206e1032b9889c28c3a3deee59ce">Will Smith and Chris Rock</a>.</p><p>“I've been doing this for a long time so I could stand up here and keep saying thank you until they play the piano,” Murphy said. "But I'm gonna wrap it up and just say something to all the up-and-coming dreamers and artists that are in the room tonight. I want to let you know that there is a definitive blueprint that you can follow to achieve success, prosperity and peace of mind. Pay your taxes, mind your business, and keep Will Smith’s wife’s name out of your (expletive) mouth!" </p><p>TEARS FOR LEAN YEARS AND LOST FAMILY</p><p>Despite the Globes’ diminishment <a href="https://apnews.com/article/golden-globe-awards-hollywood-foreign-press-association-tv-television-9ee1a25e378b0c707dcd1f5f205c405b">amid controversy</a> in recent years, winning them still brought plenty of tears, sometimes from unexpected people. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ke-huy-quan-interview-everything-everywhere-spielberg-ab2601e87b405370853ce1ab12bf5dc2">Ke Huy Quan</a> set the emotional tone as he cried throughout his acceptance of the night's first award, best supporting actor in a film for “Everything Everywhere All At Once.” He tearfully thanked Steven Spielberg for giving him his start in “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom” before talking about the decades he spent thinking he would never get to top it. </p><div id="9ce4db36f7a04293b55b453ac1a17727" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Spielberg, who has remained restrained winning bigger awards, got emotional when he won the best director Globe for “The Fabelmans." Because this one was about his family. “I’ve been hiding from this story since I was 17 years old," he said, his voice cracking. He called out each of his family members by name, ending with his late mother, Leah Adler, who inspired the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-steven-spielberg-michelle-williams-kelly-reichardt-422c17059d14192ea2ce091e784d96d8">Michelle Williams character</a> at the heart of the film, saying “she is up there kvelling about this right now.” </p><p>Jennifer Coolidge, who always seems to be doing a bit when she speaks on stage, and frequently was Tuesday night as a presenter and winner, shed a few sincere tears when she effusively thanked creator Mike White for putting her in “White Lotus,” for which she won best actress in a limited series.</p><div id="20ce34df8c714787bec4f7e2c2e5a4f9" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>“You changed my life in a million different ways,” Coolidge said. “My neighbors are speaking to me.”</p><p>White wept during the speech, and was still red-eyed minutes later when he accepted the best limited series award for the show.</p><p>EXCUSING ALL THE ABSENCES </p><p>On a night when some boycotted the show, Golden Globes presenters took the rare step of explaining, sometimes in detail, why some winners weren't there. Cate Blanchett, winner of best actress in a movie drama for “Tár,” “couldn't be here tonight because she's on production in the UK," presenter Henry Golding said.</p><p>Amanda Seyfried, winner of best actress in a limited series for “The Dropout,” “is deep in the process of creating a new musical so she could not be here tonight," presenter Mo Brings Plenty said.</p><p>Regina Hall made it clear that she was reading from a teleprompter and mocked the explanation she had to give for Kevin Costner not accepting his best actor in a TV drama award for “Yellowstone,” despite the serious subject matter of this week's <a href="https://apnews.com/article/floods-weather-natural-disasters-landslides-and-mudslides-storms-21b103e791710f4af6ca0ce45c6030b5">severe flooding in California</a>. </p><p>“He so much wanted to be here,” Hall said, shaking her head and laughing, “but because of the unprecedented weather, he has to shelter in place, in Santa Barbara.”</p><p>“Let's pray everyone,” she said, before catching herself and saying “no, that's awful.” </p><p>CARMICHAEL CASUALLY COURTS CONTROVERSY</p><p>Host Jerrod Carmichael pulled no punches with his jokes, starting with his opening monologue, in which he said he was hired “because I am Black.” A few of his on-the-edge jokes, delivered in his laid back style, fell flat, including a dig at <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2023-golden-globes-review-television-film-32311680dc48c9421eb4681fd262b579">Tom Cruise and the Church of Scientology</a>, and his calling the Beverly Hilton, the Globes' longtime home, “the hotel that killed Whitney Houston.” The superstar died in a room there in 2012. </p><p>But a joke based on the antisemitic statements of Ye, formerly Kanye West, got a strong laugh when Carmichael told Spielberg that he had seen “The Fabelmans,” which is based on Spielberg's Jewish family. </p><p>“I actually saw it with Kanye," Carmichael said, “and it changed everything for him.” </p><p>Spielberg responded with a “thank God” gesture. </p><div id="c73f1962c6174ebd8ff0e4fd3bf91be1" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>___</p><p>Follow AP Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/andyjamesdalton">https://twitter.com/andyjamesdalton</a></p>]]></description>

Internal documents obtained by the Associated Press show the World Health Organization knew of past sexual misconduct charges against a doctor who was accused of harassing a woman in the fall. (AP Photo)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>LONDON (AP) — When a doctor tweeted that she was “sexually assaulted” by a World Health Organization staffer at a Berlin conference in October, the U.N. agency’s director-general assured her that WHO had “zero tolerance” for such misconduct.</p><p>WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus replied to her, saying he was “horrified” by the accusations of groping and unwelcome sexual advances. He offered his personal assistance, WHO suspended the staffer and the agency opened an investigation that is nearing its conclusion.</p><p>But internal documents obtained by The Associated Press show the same WHO staffer, Fijian physician Temo Waqanivalu, was previously accused by another woman of sexually harassing her several years ago. That claim was flagged to senior agency directors and others in 2018, before the accuser was informed that pursuing a formal investigation might not be in her best interests, according to the documents. </p><p>A former WHO ombudsman who helped assess the previous allegation against Waqanivalu noted the similarities between the two women’s accusations, several years apart, and suggested the agency had missed a chance to root out bad behavior.</p><p>“I felt extremely angry and guilty that the dysfunctional (WHO) justice system has led to another assault that could have been prevented,” said the staffer, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity for fear of losing their job.</p><p>The previous allegation didn’t derail Waqanivalu’s career at WHO. As the new accusation surfaced, he was positioning himself for an exceptionally big promotion with a very public role: He was seeking to become WHO’s top official in the western Pacific, with support from Fiji’s prime minister, other Pacific islands and WHO colleagues, messages show. </p><p>The regional director would support countries fighting problems including dengue, malaria and heart disease, as well as coordinating the first global response to any new emerging outbreaks — as was the case when the coronavirus was first detected in China in late 2019. </p><div id="afs:Card:896032349483" content-id="fbbfa601f5dd9987ba2c011ce2d91d01" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (apf-Health) - Compressed layout </div><p>Waqanivalu hung up when the AP contacted him for comment. He didn’t respond to several follow-up requests sent through email and two messaging apps.</p><p>Waqanivalu “categorically” denied that he had ever sexually assaulted anyone, including at the Berlin conference, according to correspondence between him and WHO investigators that the AP obtained. He said the accusations were “false” and could “irreparably damage" his career and reputation.</p><p>The physician said there may have been “a mutual misunderstanding” in Berlin and that his accuser was possibly “under the influence of alcohol.” He said he was “bewildered” and “confused” by the sexual misconduct allegation.</p><p>The U.N. health agency said in an email that it could not comment on individual cases for confidentiality and due process reasons, but that sexual misconduct by anyone working for the agency is “unacceptable.”</p><p>WHO said its investigation into the Berlin conference complaint “is in its final stage” and that a report, which will not be publicly released, would soon be submitted to Tedros. </p><p>“Perpetrators of sexual misconduct face grave consequences, including dismissal,” WHO said. It added that the names of perpetrators are entered into a U.N. screening database, to avoid their future employment.</p><p>In a speech posted to Twitter in <a href="https://twitter.com/drtedros/status/1600931059017084929">December</a>, Tedros said that “sexual misconduct is particularly grave when the perpetrators are our own personnel.” He called sexual misconduct by WHO staffers “a violation of the trust placed in WHO to serve public health.”</p><p>On Wednesday, hours after this story was published, WHO told staffers it was forming a committee on “formal complaints of abusive conduct,” according to an internal email. The committee is to include 15 staffers, most of them designated by the U.N. agency’s director-general. </p><p>The claims against Waqanivalu are the latest in a series of misconduct accusations against people working for WHO, which is mandated to lead the international response to acute crises including COVID-19 and Ebola.</p><p>In May 2021, the AP reported that senior WHO managers were informed of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-europe-ebola-virus-entertainment-coronavirus-pandemic-d14715ba3653753d7c1f122f8aea79de">sex abuse allegations</a> during a Congo Ebola outbreak but did little to stop it. A panel appointed by WHO later found that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-health-united-nations-world-health-organization-ebola-virus-36ceb41d266190d149a74e400332e1ed">more than 80 workers</a> under WHO’s direction sexually abused women. No senior WHO officials tied to the exploitation have been fired. </p><p>And WHO’s last <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-japan-pandemics-asia-69fe09e70b39e9ee9325778315bd5932">regional director in the western Pacific</a> -- the person Waqanivalu was seeking to replace -- was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-health-pandemics-race-and-ethnicity-racial-injustice-9e911e739d717c4db838c7804b1a22d6">put on leave in August</a>, after AP reported that numerous staffers had accused him of racist and abusive behavior that compromised the U.N. agency’s response to COVID-19. </p><p>In the coming weeks, the agency’s highest governing body is meeting to set public health priorities and to address critical administrative concerns, including sexual misconduct. The officials also may discuss how and when the election for the region’s next director might occur.</p><p>___</p><p>The earlier accusation against Waqanivalu came after a 2017 chronic diseases workshop in Japan, where a WHO employee said that Waqanivalu had harassed her at a post-work dinner and on other occasions. Her report was shared with senior WHO officials, according to documents obtained by the AP.</p><p>“Under the table, (Waqanivalu) took off his shoes, lifted one of his legs and toe(s) between my legs,” the woman wrote in the 2018 report. “It took me a while to process what was actually happening.”</p><p>She left the restaurant and said Waqanivalu followed her to a nearby train station. That’s where he grabbed her hand, asked if she was seeing anyone and questioned why she was not attracted to him, she reported.</p><p>After she said goodbye, Waqanivalu “proceeded to give me a hug, grabbing my buttocks with both of his hands and trying to kiss my lips,” the woman said. She said she turned her head to avoid him and moved his hands. </p><p>The woman is identified in the documents, but the AP does not typically name people who say they have been sexually harassed unless they come forward publicly. The AP contacted the woman, but she declined to comment.</p><p>According to WHO protocols, her complaint should have been investigated by the organization’s office of internal oversight, following guidance from ombudsmen, who help staff mediate personnel problems. </p><p>After submitting her confidential report to WHO’s “integrity hotline” in July 2018, the case was “tossed around in (Geneva) for months” among officials tasked with misconduct claims, an ombudsman wrote to the woman in an email obtained by the AP. </p><p>“It seems our internal process is not efficient enough to address such cases,” the ombudsman said.</p><p>Months after raising her concerns, the woman was informed by the WHO ombudman’s office that its director had decided to give Waqanivalu a general “informal warning” that didn’t reference the alleged misconduct. Following that discussion, the office of the ombudsman and ethics considered the case closed, the woman wrote in an email to a WHO official.</p><p>In a follow-up message to a WHO ombudsman, the woman said the agency’s ethics office told her it would be difficult to prove a sexual harassment case, saying it might “compromise” her name and that she likely lacked “hard evidence.” She said she was also warned that Waqanivalu could file his own complaint against her for “degrading/dishonouring” his name and was told that pressing for an investigation “may not be the best option for me.”</p><p>WHO’s human resources director at the time told colleagues in a November 2018 email that the director of the agency’s compliance, risk management and ethics department had been informed of the allegations against Waqanivalu. </p><p>“He is aware of the case ... (and has) the matter in hand,” the human resources director said in an email obtained by AP. </p><p>It is unclear if any investigation was ever conducted.</p><p>___</p><p>In October, Waqanivalu sat on a panel at the World Health Summit in Berlin, a high-level conference with global heads of state.</p><p>In a hotel lobby one evening, numerous people were having drinks, including Waqanivalu and Dr. Rosie James, a young British-Canadian physician and former consultant for WHO. </p><p>“We were talking about his work at WHO and he just started putting his hand on my bottom and keeping it there,” James told the AP. She said she felt intimidated talking to a senior manager at the organization. “I felt this power dynamic and I was really uncomfortable,” she said, explaining that she moved away to join her friends, who told her Waqanivalu’s actions were inappropriate.</p><p>“Somehow I ended up talking to him again and he was literally holding my bum cheek,” she said. James said Waqanivalu “firmly held my buttock in his hand multiple times (and) pressed his groin” into her. Before Waqanivalu left, she says he cornered her and repeatedly asked for her hotel room number.</p><p>Later that night, she <a href="https://twitter.com/rosiejames96/status/1582191210328129536">tweeted</a> about the encounter, saying that she was “sexually assaulted” and that “this was not the first time in the global health sphere that this has occurred.” WHO chief Tedros <a href="https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1582297001126813697">replied</a>, pledging to do “everything we can to help you.” </p><p>James was later interviewed by WHO’s investigators. She said WHO officials told her she would not be entitled to see its final investigation report. James also said Tedros never personally followed up directly but said the agency’s communications director contacted her and that the two had lunch during the Berlin conference. She said WHO also offered to reimburse her for any private therapy costs related to her encounter with Waqanivalu. </p><p>Waqanivalu told WHO investigators he greeted James that evening “by tapping her on her left upper arm” and did not believe that was inappropriate, according to a record of the discussion obtained by AP. He acknowledged asking for her hotel room number, saying he made the request “to connect, if need be.”</p><p>“I recall that we faced each other the whole time with about an arm’s length distance between us,” Waqanivalu told investigators, adding that the conversation lasted about five minutes. He said he believed people in the group, including James, “were under the influence of alcohol” and that he remembered the event as “a good evening mixing around with everyone.”</p><p>___</p><p>Waqanivalu is a unit head at WHO’s Geneva headquarters, overseeing a small team in the non-communicable diseases department. He has been featured in several <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WHO/photos/a.167668209945237/816925701686148/?type=3">WHO Facebook videos</a> and also sits on the agency’s health, safety and wellbeing committee.</p><p>Last fall, he put himself forward as a candidate to be WHO’s next director for the western Pacific, a region that has a quarter of the world’s population. </p><p>“The experience and expertise I have gathered over the years … have given me the relevant credentials to lead the Western Pacific,” Waqanivalu wrote in a September letter addressed to Fiji’s then-Prime Minister Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama and other officials.</p><p>About a week after the Berlin conference, the chair of WHO’s top governing body in the region told Waqanivalu in a message seen by the AP that his name was mentioned “as a potential candidate” to be the next regional director. The chair messaged him to say that Pacific health ministers planned to push for a candidate from the region. </p><p>“That would be an opportunity for you, Dr. Temo,” Waqanivalu was told. </p><p>Correspondence obtained by the AP between Waqanivalu and a senior staffer in Bainimarama’s office also show Waqanivalu asked about formalizing his candidacy. </p><p>A memo from the prime minister’s office dated Oct. 17 and marked “approved,” confirmed “Fiji’s proposed candidacy” of Waqanivalu to the position. A handwritten note said officials should coordinate with the country’s ministry of health and inform all other Pacific nations of Waqanivalu’s candidacy. Bainimarama, who lost a December election in Fiji, did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the AP. </p><p>Waqanivalu’s candidacy also had supporters within WHO itself. A WHO-produced election-style campaign brochure created in September — before the Berlin conference — outlined his vision for the region and was aimed to garner votes from member countries in the region. </p><p>“Under my leadership, WHO will empower people to serve within their countries,” the document reads.</p><p>Paula Donovan is co-director of the Code Blue campaign, which seeks to hold U.N. personnel accountable for sexual offenses. She said the allegations regarding Waqanivalu were unsurprising but deeply worrying. </p><p>She said it was particularly concerning that an official accused of sexual harassment had been potentially in line for such a prominent leadership role and that WHO seemingly had failed to uphold its own “zero tolerance” policy for unprofessional behavior. </p><p>“It’s patently false that WHO does not condone sexual misconduct,” Donovan said, calling for its member countries to overhaul the agency’s internal structures so that its officials are held accountable. “When WHO keeps this kind of stuff under wraps, they are giving sexual predators carte blanche to do it again with impunity.”</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

(AP Photo/Michael Probst)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>ERKELENZ, Germany (AP) — The fate of a tiny village has sparked heated debate in Germany over the country's continued use of coal and whether tackling climate change justifies breaking the law.</p><p>Environmental activists have been locked in a standoff <a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-and-environment-germany-europe-business-8cacc38aac7b336a17e3044b15675b3e">with police who started eviction operations on Wednesday</a> in the hamlet of Luetzerath, west of Cologne, that's due to be bulldozed for the expansion of a nearby lignite mine. Some stones and fireworks were thrown at officers in riot gear as they moved into the village, clearing roadblocks and removing protesters.</p><p>Activists had <a href="https://apnews.com/article/science-germany-business-climate-and-environment-30f99144c2f3dda79403968424a358e3">refused to heed a court ruling Monday</a> effectively banning them from the area. Some dug trenches, built barricades and perched atop giant tripods in an effort to stop heavy machines from reaching the village, before police pushed them back by force.</p><p>“People are putting all of their effort, all of their lives into this struggle to keep the coal in the ground,” said Dina Hamid, a spokesperson for the activist group Luetzerath Lives.</p><p>“If this coal is burned, we’re actually going to take down our climate goals,” she said. “So we’re trying to, with our bodies, protect the climate goals.”</p><p>The debate flared up hours later at a townhall meeting in nearby Erkelenz, when one regional official accused activists of being willing to “spill human blood” to defend the now-abandoned village.</p><div id="afs:Card:926746779134" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="675d37d108cf8a1e66a1ab7079a0e01b">Hub peek embed (apf-science) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Stephan Pusch, who heads the district administration, said that while he sympathized with the protesters' aims, the time had come to give up Luetzerath. The village's last resident left in 2022 after being forced to sell to utility company RWE. </p><p>“You’ve achieved your goal. Now clear the pitch,” he said to jeers from the room.</p><p>Many disagreed, arguing that the village is more than just a potent symbol for the need to stop global warming.</p><p>Studies indicate that about 110 million metric tons of coal could be extracted from beneath Luetzerath. The government and RWE say this coal is needed to ensure Germany's energy security — squeezed by the cut in supply of Russian gas due to the war in Ukraine.</p><p>Critics counter that burning so much coal would make it much harder for Germany, and the world, to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) as agreed in the 2015 Paris climate accord.</p><p>“Nobody wants to be out there in the cold right now, defending a forest or a village,” said Maya Rollberg, a 26-year-old student who had traveled from southern Germany. "But I think that people have realized that they have to do that in order to (protect) future generations.”</p><p>Dietmar Jung, a retired priest attending the meeting, said he was tired of hearing officials say the law was on the side of RWE.</p><p>“They keep going back to the legal situation," he said. "But the right to live doesn’t play a role here (for them).”</p><p>Pusch, the regional administration chief, warned protesters that intentionally breaking the law wouldn't help their cause in a country where the violent seizure of power and the horrors of dictatorship are still within living memory.</p><p>“I'll tell you honestly that I'm scared my children will grow up in a world that isn't worth living in anymore,” he said. “But I'm at least as scared of my children growing up in a country where everyone takes the law into their own hands.”</p><p>“You won't save the world's climate on your own,” said Pusch. “(We'll) only do so if we manage to take the majority of the population with us.”</p><p>Similar debates over how far civil disobedience can go have taken place in Germany and elsewhere in recent months amid a wave of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-science-sports-blockades-794285ae9a68237635414e91e438f7ee">road blockades and other dramatic actions by protesters demanding tougher measures to combat climate change</a>. </p><p>Some climate activists say the law is ultimately on their side, citing a 2021 ruling by the country’s supreme court that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-climate-climate-change-business-environment-and-nature-80cc854f7d1bf4e34b157f94958df4cc">forced the government to step up its effort to cut emissions</a>. They also note the legally binding nature of Germany's commitments under the Paris accord. </p><p>Speaking after the townhall meeting, student Jannis Niethammer acknowledged that the dispute over Luetzerath touches on fundamental issues. "It’s a question of democracy and how do we actually get a democracy to move toward climate protection, toward climate justice,” he said.</p><p>Janine Wissler, a federal lawmaker and co-leader of the opposition Left party, suggested the way out would be for the government to reverse its decision allowing the village to be razed.</p><p>“If we want to achieve our climate targets and take the Paris climate agreement seriously, then the coal beneath Luetzerath needs to stay in the ground,” she told The Associated Press on the sidelines of the protest.</p><p>Wissler criticized an agreement struck last year between the government and utility company RWE to permit mining beneath the village in return for an earlier end to coal use in Germany. Some experts say that, in sum, the deal will lead to higher emissions.</p><p>“We’re already experiencing droughts, famines and floods. Climate change is happening already,” she said. “And therefore wrong decisions need to be corrected.”</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Frank Jordans on Twitter: @wirereporter</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

(AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — Noura’s determination to play sports was so great that she defied her family’s opposition for years. Beatings from her mother and jeers from her neighbors never stopped her from the sports she loved.</p><p>But the 20-year-old Afghan woman could not defy her country’s Taliban rulers. They have not just banned all sports for women and girls, they have actively intimidated and harassed those who once played, often scaring them from even practicing in private, Noura and other women say. </p><p>Noura has been left shattered. “I’m not the same person anymore,” she said. “Since the Taliban came, I feel like I’m dead.”</p><div id="90211d6b4bc0469f9bae1d39420e15dc" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>A number of girls and women who once played a variety of sports told The Associated Press they have been intimidated by the Taliban with visits and phone calls warning them not to engage in their sports. The women and girls spoke on condition of anonymity for fear they will face further threats.</p><p>They posed for an AP photographer for portraits with the equipment of the sports they loved. They hid their identities with burqas, the all-encompassing robes and hood that completely cover the face, leaving only a mesh to see through. They didn't normally wear the burqa, but they said they sometimes do now when they go outside and want to remain anonymous and avoid harassment.</p><div id="afs:Card:857557281710" content-id="875079d49a1c8c7063da7c14f317a8b3" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (apf-sports) - Compressed layout (automatic embed)</div><p>The ban on sports is part of the Taliban's escalating campaign of restrictions that have shut down life for girls and women. </p><div id="ebd244159e7a49519a782614706c0cf4" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Since their takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021, the Taliban have barred girls from attending middle and high school. Last month, they ordered all women thrown out of universities as well. </p><div id="afs:Content:110960806852" class="hub-link-embed">Full Coverage: Photography</div><p>The Taliban require women to cover their hair and faces in public and prohibit them from going to parks or gyms. They have severely limited women’s ability to work outside the home and most recently forbade non-governmental organizations from employing women, a step that could cripple the vital flow of aid. </p><div id="2c1e278dc3594ffc8372c654000d2f1f" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Even before the Taliban, women’s sports were opposed by many in Afghanistan’s deeply conservative society, seen as a violation of women’s modesty and of their role in society. Still, the previous, internationally-backed government had programs encouraging women's sports and school clubs, leagues and national teams for women in many sports. </p><p>A 20-year-old mixed martial artist recalled how in August 2021, she was competing in a local women’s tournament at a Kabul sports hall. Word spread through the audience and participants that the advancing Taliban were on the city’s outskirts. All the women and girls fled the hall. It was the last competition Sarina ever played in. </p><div id="92aa27282d584cc5be7637bfd42fe1bb" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Months later, she said she tried to give private lessons for girls. But Taliban fighters raided the gym where they were practicing and arrested them all. In detention, the girls were humiliated and mocked, Sarina said. After mediation by elders, they were released after promising not to practice sports anymore.</p><p>She still practices at home and sometimes teaches her close friends.</p><p>“Life has become very difficult for me, but I am a fighter, so I will continue to live and fight,” she said.</p><p>Mushwanay, spokesman of the Taliban’s Sports Organization and National Olympic Committee, said authorities were looking for a way to restart sports for women by building separate sports venues. But he gave no time frame and said funds were needed to do so. Taliban authorities have repeatedly made similar promises to allow girls 7th grade and up to return to school, but still have not done so.</p><div id="74b30e4900844e91a211d662b47f5db4" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Noura faced resistance her whole life as she tried to play sports. </p><p>Raised in a poor Kabul district by parents who migrated from the provinces, Noura started out playing soccer alongside local boys in the street. When she was nine, a coach spotted her and, at his encouragement, she joined a girls’ youth team. </p><div id="1b91a38424294d6aaef61497e97a9f20" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>She kept it a secret from everyone but her father, but her cover was blown by her own talent. At 13, she was named the best girl soccer player in her age group, and her photo and name were broadcast on television.</p><p>“All over the world, when a girl becomes famous and her picture is shown on TV, it’s a good day for her and she’s at the peak of happiness,” she said. “For me, that day was very bitter and the beginning of worse days.”</p><p>Furious, her mother beat her, shouting that she was not allowed to play soccer. She kept playing in secret but was exposed again when her team won a national championship, and her photo was in the news. Again, her mother beat her. </p><div id="d9724cd29efa43d98a3b281b8802eea3" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Still, she sneaked off to the award ceremony. She broke down in tears on stage as the audience cheered. “Only I knew I was crying because of loneliness and the hard life I had,” she said. </p><p>When she found out, her mother set fire to her soccer uniform and shoes. </p><div id="20af050a4213467cbe975c01fe20ee99" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Noura gave up soccer, but then turned to boxing. Her mother eventually relented, realizing she couldn’t stop her from sports, she said. </p><p>The day the Taliban entered Kabul, she said, her coach called her mother and said Noura should go to the airport to be taken out of the country. Noura said her mother didn’t deliver the message because she didn't want her to leave.

Sundays are elegant. Tuesdays are not.</p><p>But the embattled Hollywood Foreign Press Association probably didn’t have much say in the matter if they wanted to get <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2023-golden-globes-updates-38f7af2fc28d44729beed3c4a1527ca0">the Golden Globe Awards</a> back on broadcast television in time for its 80th anniversary. So, Tuesday it was.</p><p>Hollywood, in large part, turned out too, acting as though it wasn’t a rainy weekday in Southern California and as though they hadn’t just a year ago <a href="https://apnews.com/article/golden-globe-awards-hollywood-foreign-press-association-tv-television-9ee1a25e378b0c707dcd1f5f205c405b">protested the existence of the show.</a> Brad Pitt and Angela Bassett came.

Eddie Redmayne even had an oversized Carrie Bradshaw-esque satin flower affixed to his suit lapel. On the sodden silver carpet, Laverne Cox swooned over <a href="https://apnews.com/article/elvis-movie-review-b18e59c1b13c603e0fdd55adcea53f4d">Austin Butler</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/michelle-yeoh-movie-92b9737f7ef574ea62dec51ba12516fd">Michelle Yeoh’s</a> nominated performances, in “Elvis” and “Everything Everywhere All At Once,” respectively.

Even Spielberg, normally stoic, got teary-eyed <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-toronto-movies-film-festivals-steven-spielberg-7cb046cf458d033013f571f51905cea3">during his own turn the podium.</a></p><p>The room looked like a dimly lit lounge, with endless champagne on the tables and a piano player decked in white feathers while giving theatrical flourishes to the “Sex and the City” theme and vamping for the cameras.</p><p>Bassett and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-philadelphia-sitcoms-arts-and-entertainment-8085a9edf087ea8c6acd2cd6d0e6a568">Quinta Brunson</a> learned the hard way that reading acceptance speeches off their phones was perhaps a mistake as family and friends texted them congratulations for their win. Colin Farrell used his own acceptance speech to compliment <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-movies-film-festivals-brad-pitt-f78ac07963f02a2a30b56f1b16c85fe1">Ana de Armas’</a> performance in “Blonde,” as well as all of his <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-plays-martin-mcdonagh-colin-farrell-f5304b75bb64127e080e94e8736b8377">“Banshees of Inisherin” collaborators,</a> down to Jenny the donkey. Both he and Yeoh scolded the piano music that started to play them off.</p><p>“Shut up, please!” Yeoh said. “I can beat you up.”</p><p>It wasn’t for another hour that Carmichael would step up to clarify that the woman shown at the piano, Chloe Flower, was not actually the one playing many a winner off. It was a track, he said.</p><p>In many ways, the big film acting winners — Yeoh, Butler, Farrell and Quan — at the Globes looked like a possible rehearsal for those who might take the stage on Oscar night in March. But is that a good thing?</p><p>Depends on who you’re asking: For those campaigning, the value is clear. For those watching, well, it might just start to feel redundant. They also came very, very early in the show that somehow kept going past 11 p.m. Eastern (despite the aggressive playing off).</p><div id="69fefa758dfc419f9bc437cd6cf37d4d" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>But Carmichael kept the room on edge even well into the show as he came out, some 90 minutes in, holding “Tom Cruise’s three returned Golden Globe statuettes” and suggesting they could be used in exchange for “the safe return of Shelly Miscavige," Scientology leader David Miscavige’s wife who hasn’t been seen in public for years.</p><p>“Anyway, from ‘Top Gun: Maverick,’ please welcome Glen Powell and Jay Ellis,” Carmichael followed, introducing two <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-tom-cruise-jerry-bruckheimer-california-74bbbb5552c75cb268ae8298e4fe1379">Cruise co-stars.</a></p><p>Moments later, Shelly Miscavige was trending on Twitter.</p><p>“It’s a good thing Tom’s not here,” Ellis said. It was about something else, technically, but also not.</p><p>Later, Carmichael got in an edgy dig in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-oscars-will-smith-chris-rock-confrontation-f90b206e1032b9889c28c3a3deee59ce">at Will Smith</a> too, saying they gave him the “Rock Hudson award for best portrayal of masculinity on television” during the commercial break.</p><p>Carmichael was the live wire that kept the otherwise typical show interesting. WHAT would he say next, everyone wondered? He made <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-ap-top-news-us-news-tv-movies-3d0af1ec9691b0f54e85641f2cfb6c4a">Ricky Gervais</a> look tame. Because aside from Carmichael's go-for-broke unpredictability, the 80th Golden Globe Awards was just that: Typical.</p><p>There were truly moving moments and truly boring ones too and it stayed past its welcome and got less and less climactic as the night went on. Who made the decision to present most of the major film awards at the beginning of the show? By the time <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-ap-top-news-us-news-tv-movies-3d0af1ec9691b0f54e85641f2cfb6c4a">Eddie Murphy</a> finally got his Cecil B. DeMille honor and got in his own dig at Smith, it felt as though the show was already on its fourth ending. But there were still honors, the obligatory HFPA president speech and a shouting Quentin Tarantino to come.</p><p>What do we really want in an awards show? It’s the big, existential question that doesn’t just plague the Golden Globes. A little dose of Coolidge, <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/regina-hall">Regina Hall</a> and a tipsy, hungry <a href="https://apnews.com/article/emmy-awards-live-blog-96491c8e800e7c81a9d2f59c5518c6a8">Mike White</a> never hurts. But the fact remains: It’s hard to throw a comeback party on a Tuesday.</p><div id="afs:Card:958899307023" content-id="32311680dc48c9421eb4681fd262b579" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (apf-entertainment) - Compressed layout </div>]]></description>

(Jan. 11)</p>    <p>ROME (AP) — Pope Francis on Wednesday paid tribute to Cardinal George Pell, who spent 404 days in solitary confinement in his native Australia before his child sex convictions were overturned, praising his diligence in reforming the Vatican’s finances and his faith “even in the hour of trial.” </p><p>Francis sent a telegram of condolences to the head of the College of Cardinals, expressing his “sadness” over Pell's death and relaying his prayers and sympathy to the Australian prelate's family.</p><p>Pell died Tuesday in Rome, where he had attended the funeral last week of Pope Benedict XVI. Pell suffered fatal heart complications following hip surgery, said Archbishop Peter Comensoli, Pell’s successor as archbishop of Melbourne. He was 81.</p><p>He was a divisive figure. He lived to see Vatican rivals charged with financial crimes after he worked to reform the Holy See's finances. In Australia, he was a lightning rod for disagreements over whether the Catholic Church had been properly held to account for historic child sex abuse.</p><p>Sydney Catholic Archbishop Anthony Fisher told reporters the death had come as a shock.</p><p>“It will be for historians to assess his impact on the life of the church in Australia and beyond, but it was considerable and will be long lasting,” Fisher said.</p><div id="afs:Card:057759945916" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="d8087dd6a8e0c7401da109144714cce4">Hub peek embed (PopeFrancis) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“For many people, particularly of the Catholic faith, this will be a difficult day and I express my condolences to all those who are mourning today,” said Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Fisher said a requiem for Pell would be held at St. Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican in the next few days, and in time his body would be brought back to Australia for a funeral Mass and buried in the crypt at St. Mary’s Cathedral in Sydney.</p><p>Journalist Lucie Morris-Marr, who wrote the book “Fallen” about Pell’s trial, said on Twitter that Pell’s death “will be terribly triggering for many Australians impacted by Catholic child sexual abuse and not just those involved in his trial.”</p><p>Pell, the former archbishop of Melbourne and Sydney, became the third-highest ranked official in the Vatican after Pope Francis tapped him in 2014 to reform the Vatican’s notoriously opaque finances as the Holy See’s first-ever finance czar.</p><div id="55bf47e4f3cc4185895b3b8f1671da1b" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>He spent three years as prefect of the newly created Secretariat for the Economy, where he tried to impose international budgeting, accounting and transparency standards.</p><p>But Pell returned to Australia in 2017 in an attempt to clear his name of child sex charges dating from his time as archbishop.</p><p>A Victoria state County Court jury convicted him of molesting two 13-year-old choirboys at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in the latest 1990s shortly after he had become archbishop of Melbourne. An initial trial had ended in a jury deadlock. Pell served 404 days in solitary confinement before the full-bench of the High Court unanimously overturned his convictions in 2020 on appeal.</p><p>The High Court found there was reasonable doubt surrounding the testimony of the main witness, now the father of a young family aged in his 30s, who said Pell had abused him and another choirboy. </p><p>In the telegram, Francis praised Pell’s consistent dedication to the church “and particularly the diligent cooperation given to the Holy See in the context of its recent economic reform, of which he laid the foundation with determination and wisdom.”</p><p>Francis said he was praying for the “faithful servant who has followed his Lord with perseverance even in the hour of trial.”</p><p>During his time in prison, Pell kept a diary documenting everything from his prayers and Scripture readings to his conversations with visiting chaplains and the prison guards. The journal turned into a triptych, “Prison Journal,” the proceeds of which went to pay his substantial legal bills.</p><p>In the diary, Pell reflected on the nature of suffering, Pope Francis’ papacy and the humiliations of solitary confinement as he battled to clear his name for a crime he insisted he never committed.</p><p>Pell and his supporters believed he was scapegoated for all the crimes of the Australian Catholic Church’s botched response to clergy sexual abuse. Victims and critics say he epitomized everything wrong with how the church has dealt with the problem, pointing in particular to a widely circulated photo of a young Pell accompanying a notorious abuser, Gerald Risdale, to court.</p><p>The U.S. survivor group SNAP bitterly complained that Pell’s “serious wrongdoing is already ignored and minimized by the church’s hierarchy.” It accused him of covering up clergy sex crimes. “His true sentence begins with death,” the group tweeted.</p><p>Pell strongly denied his own abuse allegations and repeatedly defended his response to the abuse scandal while a bishop and later the archbishop of Melbourne, though he acknowledged the Catholic hierarchy as a whole had <a href="https://apnews.com/article/8bccd6529c124851b8ab6ac627760f7a">made “enormous mistakes.”</a> He expressed regret over encounters with victims seeking compensation, saying he and others in the church failed in their moral and pastoral responsibilities to them.</p><p>Anthony Foster testified at one of Australia's inquiries into abuse that when he and his wife sought compensation over the abuse their daughters suffered, Pell showed a “sociopathic lack of empathy.”</p><p>Even after he was acquitted of the Melbourne allegations, Pell’s reputation remained tarnished by the scandal and in particular his handling of other priests who abused children and his treatment of victims. Australian inquiries concluded that Pell created a victims’ compensation program mainly to limit the church’s liability, and that he aggressively tried to discourage victims from pursuing lawsuits.</p><p>Australia’s Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, the highest form of inquiry in the country, also found that he knew of clergy molesting children in the 1970s and did not take adequate action to address it. </p><p>Pell had <a href="https://apnews.com/article/5f46666f7d604212aa6c9032ad787b3b">testified remotely to the Royal Commission</a> over four days in Rome in 2016, a remarkable moment in the history of the church's reckoning with abuse that saw a top Vatican cardinal sitting in a hotel conference room answering questions via video link from 10 p.m.-2 a.m. each night, with victims, journalists and supporters in the audience. </p><p>The late-night hours were set to accommodate Australian time zones after Pell argued that his heart condition made flying too dangerous. But it had the effect of amplifying testimony that might have remained confined to Australia to a global audience.</p><p>After his testimony, Pell met with Australian survivors who had traveled to Rome to hear him in person. He acknowledged that he had failed to act on an allegation a decade ago and vowed to work to put an end to the rash of suicides in his Australian hometown of Ballarat, where scores of people had taken their lives as a result of the trauma of their abuse.</p><p>“We now know it was one of the very worst places in Australia” for child sex crimes, Pell said at the time.</p><p>After he was held responsible for failing to take adequate action by the Royal Commission, Pell said he was surprised by the findings and that they weren't “supported by evidence.” </p><p>With his rather brusque, no-nonsense Australian sensibilities, Pell clashed frequently with the Vatican’s Italian old guard during the years he worked to get a handle on the Vatican’s assets and spending. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sexual-abuse-by-clergy-australia-george-pell-pope-francis-sexual-abuse-f2c5b3129f51c96f9960affa8b0b904f">He was vindicated</a> when Vatican prosecutors put 10 people, including his onetime nemesis, on trial in 2021 for a host of alleged financial crimes.</p><p>The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/london-europe-voting-rights-business-religion-4abac4eee3bfd02205349c353906fcbf">ongoing trial against Cardinal Angelo Becciu</a>, during Pell’s tenure the No. 2 in the secretariat of state, mostly concerns the office’s 350 million euro investment in a London real estate deal. Pell’s biggest battle had been to wrest control of the office’s asset portfolio, which remained off the Holy See's balance sheets and was managed by a few inexperienced monsignors and laymen who lost the Vatican tens of millions in euros.</p><p>Only in the last year, nearly a decade after Pell first announced that he had uncovered nearly 1 billion euros in unreported assets, has Francis ordered the secretariat of state’s entire financial portfolio moved into the Vatican’s centralized patrimony office for more professional management and accounting.</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-archive-de543e22f6c69157db07b54f1b041258">After Pell returned to Rome</a> following his release from prison in 2020, he had a well-publicized private audience with Francis.</p><p>“He acknowledged what I was trying to do,” Pell said of the pope during a 2020 interview. “And, you know, I think it’s been sadly vindicated by revelations and developments.”</p><p>Francis said as much in a recent interview with Italy’s Mediaset broadcaster, crediting Pell with having set the Vatican on the path of financial transparency and lamenting that he was forced to abandon the effort to face the “calumny” of the abuse charges back home.</p><p>“It was Pell who laid out how we could go forward. He’s a great man and we owe him so much,” Francis said last month.</p><p>Pell was born on June 8, 1941, the eldest of three children to a heavyweight champion boxer and publican also named George Pell, an Anglican. His mother Margaret Lillian (nee Burke) was from an Irish Catholic family.</p><p>He grew up in the Victorian regional town of Ballarat.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The infighting was so intense a year ago that Democrats who controlled both the White House and Congress couldn't win support for a sweeping social spending package that was the party's top legislative priority. President Joe Biden, meanwhile, was viewed skeptically enough that some of his fellow Democrats questioned the wisdom of him seeking reelection.</p><p>What a difference a year makes. </p><p>Speculation about Biden's political future has quieted after Democrats <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-race-and-ethnicity-congress-government-politics-b5a279d322326f581304df50020a9d47">outperformed expectations</a> during the November <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections">midterm elections</a>. His toughest critics on the left are signaling they'll work to help him secure a second term.</p><p>And perhaps most notably, last year's dissent on Capitol Hill melted away over the past week as every Democrat voted — repeatedly — in support of <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/hakeem-jeffries">Hakeem Jeffries</a> for the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-house-of-representatives-kevin-mccarthy-us-republican-party-0938c7358f41c83759246f8949ac7c15">House speakership</a>. That was the type of showing Republican <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/kevin-mccarthy">Kevin McCarthy</a> could only long for as he worked through 15 votes over four <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-kevin-mccarthy-matt-gaetz-florida-f2a4a42b4845f2413cca5c1b4c6100dd">bruising days</a> to finally win backing from his party to take the gavel.</p><p>That unity is a shift for a Democratic Party built on fragile electoral coalitions that often begin to fray when it's time to govern. But the dynamic was a tonic of sorts for lawmakers otherwise unhappy to be shifting to the House minority and spurred optimism that the party could stick together heading into the next campaign, when both Congress and the White House are at stake. </p><div id="afs:Card:130243251955" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="7f6ca4a312f42eb4f1d08878ea94c369">Hub peek embed (JoeBiden) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“It’s a very powerful feeling,” New Hampshire Democratic Rep. Annie Kuster said of Jeffries receiving all 3,179 votes for speaker of the 3,179 cast by his party’s House members. “It’s sort of a championship moment.”</p><p>Of course, the unity may not prove sustainable. It will get an immediate test as the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-united-states-government-812ef44a5333f6d93423a67a683fa024">Department of Justice investigates</a> potentially classified documents found in the Washington office space of Biden’s former institute — which Republicans are likening to federal authorities probing of former President Donald Trump keeping hundreds of such records at his Florida club. </p><p>Tensions could also come from fellow Democrats on policy issues like <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/immigration">immigration</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/police-reform">police reform</a>, raising the <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/minimum-wage">minimum wage</a>, expanding <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/voting-rights">voting rights</a> and better protecting access to <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/abortion">abortion</a> — all areas where the party's progressive wing would like to see Biden and the establishment do more. </p><p>Joseph Geevarghese, executive director of the progressive advocacy group Our Revolution, said grassroots activists and elected officials around the country understand the strategic value of the party holding firm during so many House speaker votes. </p><p>But he warned that it may not last. </p><p>“I don’t think this show of unity should create any illusion that progressives are going to pull their punches,” Geevarghese said. “There’s an old organizing adage, ’No permanent allies, no permanent enemies, only permanent interests.'”</p><p>Indeed, McCarthy alluded to how hard it will be for Democrats to stave off eventual dissent within their own ranks, joking, “Hakeem, I’ve got to warn you: Two years ago, I got 100% of the vote from my conference.” That recalled House Republicans uniformly opposing Democrat Nancy Pelosi as speaker in 2021, when doing so was easier than settling on someone to actually run the House. </p><p>Still, former New York Rep. Steve Israel, who was a top Pelosi adviser, predicted that additional divisions within the House GOP would make it easier for Democrats to find common ground. </p><p>“I expect that House Republicans will pursue a vitriolic agenda that pleases their own base and that will keep Democrats united for the next two years," said Israel, who headed the House Democratic campaign arm from 2011 to 2015 and now directs the Cornell University Institute of Politics and Global Affairs. </p><p>That's a far cry from early last year, when Democratic congressional disagreements derailed Build Back Better, an environmental and social spending proposal that was supposed to be the centerpiece of Biden's domestic agenda. </p><p>The president later salvaged some of that package's green energy and health care priorities via a major spending bill. He also scored key victories on a bipartisan <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-congress-infrastructure-bill-signing-b5b8cca843133de060778f049861b144">infrastructure package</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-signs-gun-violence-bill-c21249287f976c2c164d8753205c2e6d">new gun safety regulations</a> and bolstering <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-covid-science-technology-health-fdcb2db42f91dcdbdd844d6dd463f95a">U.S. technology manufacturing</a>.</p><p>Democrats additionally made progress in expanding Medicaid for the poorest children, capping insulin prices for Medicare recipients and giving Medicare the ability to negotiate drug pricing — all of which seemingly satiated many progressives, at least for now.</p><p>The party did that despite having a House majority about as razor-thin as the one that left Republicans unable to settle on a speaker for so long last week. Jeffries has also been part of the Progressive Congressional Caucus, but that hasn't prevented other disagreements from surfacing. </p><p>Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., head of the progressive House caucus, has already co-authored a statement calling “unacceptable” a Biden administration announcement that it would continue enforcing Title 42, the emergency powers that allows officials on the U.S.-Mexico border to quickly turn away migrants, amid court orders. </p><p>Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., also is gearing up for a primary challenge against incumbent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who recently left the Democratic Party to become an independent, because of her past opposition progressive legislation. </p><p>Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who launched Democratic presidential primary challenges from the left against Biden in 2020 and Hillary Clinton in 2016, has vowed to campaign against his own colleagues, promising to try to defeat Sinema and moderate West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin.</p><p>Sanders <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-us-republican-party-united-states-government-democratic-b48e137a0c2d182cfdc331a6b67e6559">hasn't ruled out a third White House run</a> but plans to support Biden if he runs — and the party appears to be coalescing around the president, whose aides and allies are preparing for a reelection run, even though one hasn’t yet been formally announced. </p><p>That's despite Biden being the oldest president in U.S. history and remaining <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-inflation-united-states-government-and-politics-afe0d0d66a1097b3defb7999b2b378f5">unpopular,</a> with just 43% job approval rating — even after Democrats' strong midterm elections showings. One progressive group isn't onboard, paying for a national cable TV spot and mobile billboard circulating between the White House and U.S. Capitol proclaiming, “Don't Run, Joe." </p><p>But Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., a rising star on the left and possible future presidential contender, said that what he's telling "my friends on the progressive side is it’s in our interest to have the president succeed as much as possible, and then we can argue about what the future is post Biden.”</p><p>“I definitely want to be part of the conversation about the future of the party," Khanna said. "And I know probably that conversation starts in 2028.”</p><p>Geevarghese struck a similar, conciliatory tone, saying Our Revolution has enjoyed a strong working relationship with Biden despite it having grown out of Sanders' 2016 White House bid. </p><p>“There’s a conversation that’s been happening where progressive feel like we have an opening with Joe Biden to press our priorities," Geevarghese said. “We may not win everything. But we’re a partner in the process.” </p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Steve Peoples in New York and Mary Clare Jalonick in Washington contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The federal government is on track to max out on its $31.4 trillion borrowing authority as soon as this month, starting the clock on an expected standoff between President Joe Biden and the new House Republican majority that will test both parties' ability to navigate <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-us-republican-party-united-states-house-of-representatives-kevin-mccarthy-b9fcfd11427a695fe2eb49e36988f1a0">a divided Washington</a>, with the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-business-china-world-bank-economy-391bd23625e205a0d94c1d1c224892a8">fragile global economy</a> at stake.</p><p>Once the government bumps up against the cap — it could happen any time in the next few weeks or longer — the Treasury Department will be unable to issue new debt without congressional action. The department plans to deploy what are known as “extraordinary measures” to keep the government operating. But once those measures run out, probably mid-summer, the government could be at risk of defaulting unless lawmakers and the president agree to lift the limit on the U.S. government's ability to borrow.</p><p>The expected showdown over the debt limit would be a stark display of the new reality for Biden and his fellow Democrats, who enjoyed one-party control of Washington for the past two years. It would presage the challenges to come in achieving even the modest ambitions that Democrats are bringing to the task of legislating in a divided Capitol.</p><p>The White House has insisted that it won't allow the nation's credit to be held captive to the demands of newly empowered GOP lawmakers. But the concessions made by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-house-of-representatives-kevin-mccarthy-us-republican-party-0938c7358f41c83759246f8949ac7c15">new House Speaker Kevin McCarthy</a> in his arduous path to securing the job raise questions about whether he has the ability to cut any kind of deal to resolve a standoff. </p><div id="afs:Card:130243251955" content-id="84ef9d1c5803bd25e8e9cc3538cd0ab2" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (JoeBiden) - Compressed layout (automatic embed)</div><p>McCarthy, who <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-government-kevin-mccarthy-house-of-representatives-4922d22689eb79d5d05c1b49ca733123">secured his post</a> after 15 rounds of voting and major compromises with hard-line members of his caucus, has said that his fellow Republicans will only agree to increase the debt ceiling in return for spending cuts of unspecified magnitude. And a new rule that allows any lawmaker to trigger a vote for McCarthy's removal could make even the most urgent of votes a dicey matter.</p><div class="social-embed" id="se0:263ad300-7820-11ed-a3cb-cb3ea16faaed"><iframe title="Debt limit debate looms" aria-label="Interactive area chart" id="ap-chart-ezt0S" src="https://interactives.ap.org/embeds/ezt0S/4/" scrolling="no" width="100%" style="border:none" height="440" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe><p class="social-caption"> </p></div><p>McCarthy said he’s spoken with Biden about the coming debt ceiling and told the president “it doesn’t have to come to that” — meaning a federal government shutdown over spending levels.</p><p>“This is our moment to change the behavior,” McCarthy said Tuesday on Fox News Channel’s “Hannity.”</p><p>But the new speaker stopped short of saying Republicans now in charge of the House would go so far as to refuse to pass the annual spending bills needed to fund the government, as happened more than a decade ago during an earlier debt ceiling showdown in Congress.</p><p>“We’re going to look at every single dollar spent,” McCarthy said.</p><p>The stakes are treacherous. Past forecasts suggest a default could instantly bury the country in a deep recession, right at a moment of slowing global growth as the U.S. and much of the world face high inflation because of the coronavirus pandemic and <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine">Russia’s invasion of Ukraine</a>.</p><p>The White House has ruled out executive action to stave off a default.</p><p>“Congress is going to need to raise the debt limit without — without — conditions, and it’s just that simple,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said recently. “Attempts to exploit the debt ceiling as leverage will not work. There will be no hostage taking.”</p><p>On Capitol Hill, Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, one of the McCarthy holdouts and an outspoken critic of government spending, wouldn't rule out trying to oust McCarthy if he fails to live up to his pledge to seek spending cuts along with any debt limit increase.</p><p>“We will use the tools of the House to enforce the terms of the agreement,” Roy told CNN on Sunday.</p><p>Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., said in a Fox News interview on Monday that the debt limit will be “the real test” for conservatives. Republicans have to begin “leveraging power to accomplish what you need to accomplish," he said. Good fought McCarthy’s bid to become speaker until the final vote, when he responded “present.” </p><p>The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-biden-prices-national-debt-congress-d85ae0ba056412286bef497422c34969">debt ceiling debate</a> is a form of political theater — it encourages lawmakers to engage in brinkmanship in the name of fiscal responsibility — though past showdowns have done little to meaningfully alter the long-term rise in federal debt.</p><p>House Republican leaders liken the debt ceiling to a credit card limit, promising to put “mechanisms in place so that you don’t keep maxing it out,” in the words of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana.</p><p>“We’re going to confront this, and I think the American people have called on us to confront this,” Scalise said.</p><p>Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida pointed to his 2021 proposed amendment to the Senate Republican Conference that commits to only raising the debt ceiling if it also secures spending reform.</p><p>“I’ll be fighting with every tool at my disposal to enforce this rule that every Republican in the Senate agreed to follow,” Scott said. “A day of reckoning is coming.”</p><p>Any effort to compromise with House Republicans could force Biden to bend on his own priorities, whether that's the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-manchin-congress-internal-revenue-service-government-and-politics-dd2e6eaeb914eea553615e231332f3fb">funding of the IRS</a> to ensure that wealthier Americans pay what they owe or domestic programs for children and the poor. </p><p>It's hard to peg the date when the government will hit its debt ceiling, because payments and receipts vary from day to day, especially with the April filing deadline for income taxes. The current balance suggests the debt ceiling could be reached as early as this week or as late as March.</p><p>When Treasury takes extraordinary measures to keep the government running, it can halt contributions to pension funds and borrow from accounts to manage changes in the foreign exchange rate, freeing up cash to meet its other obligations.</p><p>Treasury first used these measures in 1985 and has used them <a href="https://www.crfb.org/papers/qa-everything-you-should-know-about-debt-ceiling">at least 16 times since</a>, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog. But the extraordinary measures only work for so long, and would likely run out — and put the U.S. at risk of default — sometime around the summer.</p><p>If the government were to default, financial markets could be expected to crash. Several million workers could be laid off. The world could feel the aftershocks of the crisis for years to come. Moody's Analytics called this risk “cataclysmic” in a 2021 forecast ahead of the previous debt ceiling increase, suggesting that the resulting chaos would be due to government dysfunction, rather than the underlying health of the U.S. economy.</p><p>“Debt limit negotiations are always protracted and almost always contentious, and the political trends seem to make it likely that they will exacerbate those tendencies and will create a volatile situation," said Shai Akabas, director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, which forecasts the so-called <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/press-release/debt-limit-x-date-further-out-than-expected-but-still-looms-ahead/">X-date</a> when the government exhausts its extraordinary measures.</p><p>Akabas told The Associated Press the X-date has "likely moved forward" from this year's third quarter due to rising interest rates and a pause on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-united-states-government-miguel-cardona-business-73dcbf54ddb3b53c9c3c5468cfdec3b9">student loan repayments</a> recently extended by the Biden administration. A more precise date will become available when the Congressional Budget Office updates its outlook later this month. </p><p>Either way, lawmakers know the risks that they're taking with the livelihoods of people across the country by having this dispute. Economists have warned them plenty of times.</p><p>A 2013 Treasury report drew on the debt ceiling impasse in 2011, when Republicans had also just won a House majority. It outlined how impasses contribute to long-lasting scars on financial markets, noting that business and household confidence fell to levels that are typically only seen during recessions.</p><p>"It took months before confidence recovered, even though, ultimately, there was no default," the report said.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Kevin Freking, Zeke Miller and Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

He said he was unaware of what was happening to his partner. </p><p>Prime Minister Alberto Otárola confirmed Soncco’s death in a session of Congress, saying the men were attacked by protesters. </p><p>“Police arrived at the scene and found that one officer had been beaten and tied up, and the other, Luis Soncco Quispe, unfortunately had died,” he said. “He was burned alive in his patrol car.”</p><p>Otárola announced a three-day curfew from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. in Puno, and a day of mourning for the fallen on Wednesday. </p><div id="afs:Card:643951047327" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="286beca28250750391d1b2c8963779b9">Hub peek embed (apf-trendingnews) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Peru’s Ombudsman’s Office said that since the protests began in early December after Castillo's dismissal, 39 civilians had been killed in clashes with police and another seven had died in traffic accidents, as well as the fallen police officer. </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The police officer’s death came after the killing of 17 people Monday in Juliaca as protests seeking immediate elections resumed in neglected rural areas of the country still loyal to Castillo. </p><p>The unrest began following Castillo’s removal and arrest following a widely condemned attempt to dissolve Congress and head off his own impeachment.</p><p>Castillo’s successor, his former running mate Dina Boluarte, has supported a plan to push up to 2024 elections for president and congress originally scheduled for 2026. She’s also expressed support for judicial investigations into whether security forces acted with excessive force. </p><p>But such moves have so far failed to quell the unrest, which after a short respite around the Christmas and New Year’s holidays have resumed with force in some of Peru’s poorest areas, where support for Castillo’s unorthodox rule had been strongest. </p><p>Castillo, a political novice who lived in a two-story adobe home in the Andean highlands before moving to the presidential palace, eked out a narrow victory in elections in 2021 that rocked Peru’s political establishment and laid bare the deep divisions between residents of the capital, Lima, and the long-neglected countryside.</p>]]></description>

(Jan. 10) (AP video/Yong Ho Kim and Yong Jun Chang)</p>    <p>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea's spike in missile tests, growing nuclear ambitions and other provocative acts pose a “serious threat” that could lead to a dangerous miscalculation and spark a wider conflict, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said Tuesday. </p><p>Speaking with The Associated Press at the presidential office in Seoul, the conservative leader reiterated his call for closer security cooperation with the United States and Japan to counter the “dangerous situation” being created by North Korea as he played down the prospect for direct negotiations like those pursued by his liberal predecessor.</p><p>“We’ve seen a miscalculation leading to serious wars many times in history,” Yoon said, adding that the North’s advancing nuclear arsenal poses a direct threat to the U.S. mainland as well as South Korea and nearby Japan.</p><p>Much of the nearly hourlong interview focused on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-south-korea-north-government-3e6e8aff8d6d3e932f715d431cf7d2ae">North Korea, which carried out a record number of missile tests last year</a> and just weeks ago <a href="https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-jets-north-korea-drones-8ae75ec612d676455529499a3f20eabb">violated South Korean airspace by flying drones across the border</a> for the first time in five years.</p><p>That incursion prompted the South to fire warning shots, scramble jets and fly its own drones over the border.</p><p>Days later, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-north-korea-south-895fb34033780fdafd5bf925b376a2c6">North Korean leader Kim Jong Un began the new year by ordering the “exponential” expansion of his nuclear arsenal</a> and the development of a more powerful intercontinental ballistic missile.</p><p>Some experts believe the testing spree is largely meant to modernize an arsenal that North Korea would ultimately want to use as leverage in future dealings with the United States to wrest sanctions relief and other concessions.</p><p>“North Korea could have its own internal reasons, but there’s no way for our country or any other country to know exactly why they are conducting such provocations,” Yoon said.</p><p>“These unlawful North Korean provocations can only result in the strengthening of (South Korea’s) security response capabilities and a further strengthening of the security cooperation between South Korea, the United States and Japan,” he said.</p><p>Yoon, a former top prosecutor, took office in May vowing to take a tougher stance on North Korea. During the presidential election campaign, he accused his liberal predecessor, Moon Jae-in, of being “submissive” to North Korea. </p><div id="9a94aaa764d14e09bd295314255c8335" class="media-placeholder"></div><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-joe-biden-health-seoul-pyongyang-1107dc67bd1736351add4c87f4bb0d88">Moon, who met Kim Jong Un three times, was credited with arranging now-dormant nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington</a> and easing fears of war. But he invited criticism that his dovish engagement policy eventually helped Kim Jong Un buy time and perfect weapons technologies in the face of U.N. sanctions. </p><p>In a recent newspaper interview, Yoon cited discussions with the U.S. about joint planning potentially involving U.S. nuclear assets.</p><div id="afs:Card:245275527179" content-id="06eda2aee0a8b33c30419251e06cd69f" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (SouthKorea) - Compressed layout </div><p>Asked for further clarity Tuesday, he said the proposed plans include “tabletop exercises, computer simulations and drills ... on delivery means for nuclear weapons.”</p><p>“The discussions are under way over the so-called joint planning and joint execution, and I think it’s right for South Korea and the United States to cooperate because both of us are exposed to the North Korean nuclear threat,” Yoon said.</p><p>While Yoon didn’t reveal further details, some observers have said he likely wants to stress efforts to boost the viability of the U.S. security commitment to protect its Asian ally from North Korea.</p><p>In a policy report to Yoon on Wednesday, Defense Minister Lee Jong-Sup said the South Korean and U.S. militaries plan to hold a tabletop exercise next month to sharpen their response to scenarios where North Korea uses a nuclear weapon. Lee said that South Korea will push for the U.S. to deploy strategic assets near the Korean Peninsula more frequently, according to Lee’s office. </p><p>Despite the heightened animosities, Yoon maintained he won’t pursue talks for the sake of talks with North Korea, saying past inter-Korean discussions were often politically exploited by leaders in both countries and failed to eliminate the North’s nuclear program.</p><p>Yoon also accused North Korea of cutting off all communication channels with South Korea. Pointing at a white telephone on a desk that he said is meant for a direct hotline with the North Korean leader, Yoon said that “The North is obstructing this line and isn’t coming to dialogue.”</p><p>Yoon also voiced his support for Ukraine in its fight to repel Russia’s invasion, which he called “unlawful and illegitimate.”</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-zelenskyy-europe-south-korea-seoul-6320ab452a94b976d1a19e7ef8b4af3c">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged South Korea to provide arms</a> and other military equipment. The Asian country, a growing arms exporter with a well-equipped, U.S.-backed military, has provided humanitarian aid and other support while joining U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow. But it has stopped short of providing arms directly.</p><p>Yoon said Korean laws, as well as domestic public opinion, make it difficult for his government to arm Ukraine while it is at war.</p><p>An American official said in November that the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-business-south-korea-government-and-politics-15569a7bfdb6c53404cfce5f0df1c28f">U.S. agreed to buy 100,000 artillery rounds from South Korean manufacturers</a> to provide to Ukraine. South Korea maintains that the rounds it was selling were meant to backfill depleted U.S. stocks.</p><p>Yoon expressed openness to similar deals in the future, noting the two allies regularly buy military equipment from one another. </p><p>“If the conflict (in Ukraine) isn’t resolved swiftly, it could send a message to North Korea that the international community would fail to respond to an act of invasion with the appropriate sanctions or punishment, and that message would further encourage the North to conduct provocations.”</p><p>On the domestic front, Yoon appeared to still be shaken by the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-seoul-covid-south-korea-95c403f1712f8dbfab96e9da88366b03">crowd crush tragedy that killed nearly 160 Halloween revelers in late October in Seoul’s Itaewon neighborhood.</a></p><p>He described rushing to his office, not far from the neighborhood, soon after hearing the first reports. He said he initially did not know how many people had been killed and only later came to realize the scale of the disaster.</p><p>“It’s still hard for me to fully understand how such a huge crowd accident can happen in a country with a (developed) system like ours because of a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-seoul-covid-south-korea-6b3b145241901e6917b8addbc209f47b">failure in crowd management,</a> ” he said. </p><p>Authorities ordered a sweeping investigation, but no senior officials have lost their jobs so far despite calls by families of the victims and members of the opposition for greater accountability. </p><p>Yoon said it was important to conduct a thorough investigation before assigning blame.</p><p>“For victims and relatives, the results of the investigation could provide a base to establish the government’s responsibility, so I instructed (officials) to thoroughly investigate the government’s responsibility, even if that means taking a lot of responsibility,” Yoon said.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

He was 81. </p><p>Pell suffered fatal heart complications following hip surgery, said Archbishop Peter Comensoli, Pell's successor as archbishop of Melbourne. Pell had been in Rome to attend the funeral last week of Pope Benedict XVI.</p><p>“For many people, particularly of the Catholic faith, this will be a difficult day and I express my condolences to all those who are mourning today,” said Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.</p><p>Sydney Catholic Archbishop Anthony Fisher told reporters the death had come as a shock.</p><p>“It will be for historians to assess his impact on the life of the church in Australia and beyond, but it was considerable and will be long lasting,” Fisher said. </p><p>Fisher said a requiem for Pell would be held at St. Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican in the next few days, and in time his body would be brought back to Australia for a funeral mass and buried in the crypt at St. Mary’s Cathedral in Sydney. </p><p>Journalist Lucie Morris-Marr, who wrote the book “Fallen" about Pell's trial, said on Twitter that Pell's death “will be terribly triggering for many Australians impacted by Catholic child sexual abuse and not just those involved in his trial.”</p><div id="afs:Card:057759945916" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="2124df94744bb3aae1355da240271150">Hub peek embed (PopeFrancis) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Pell, the former archbishop of Melbourne and Sydney, became the third-highest ranked official in the Vatican after Pope Francis tapped him in 2014 to reform the Vatican's notoriously opaque finances as the Holy See's first-ever finance czar. </p><p>He spent three years as prefect of the newly created Secretariat for the Economy, where he tried to impose international budgeting, accounting and transparency standards.</p><p>But Pell returned to Australia in 2017 in an attempt to clear his name of child sex charges dating from his time as archbishop.</p><p>A Victoria state County Court jury initially convicted him of molesting two 13-year-old choirboys at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in the latest 1990s shortly after he had become archbishop of Melbourne. Pell served 404 days in solitary confinement before the full-bench of the High Court unanimously overturned his convictions in 2020.</p><div id="55bf47e4f3cc4185895b3b8f1671da1b" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>During his time in prison, Pell kept a diary documenting everything from his prayers and Scripture readings to his conversations with visiting chaplains and the prison guards. The journal turned into a triptych, “Prison Journal,” the proceeds of which went to pay his substantial legal bills.</p><p>In the diary, Pell reflected on the nature of suffering, Pope Francis’ papacy and the humiliations of solitary confinement as he battled to clear his name for a crime he insists he never committed.</p><p>Pell and his supporters believe he was scapegoated for all the crimes of the Australian Catholic Church’s botched response to clergy sexual abuse. Victims and critics say he epitomized everything wrong with how the church has dealt with the problem.</p><p>“Looking back, I was probably excessively optimistic that I’d get bail,” Pell <a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-sexual-abuse-by-clergy-religion-d25db09ed053f69fd282f60085406888">said in a 2021 interview</a> at his home in Rome, crediting his “glass half-full” attitude to his Christian faith.</p><p>Even after he was acquitted, Pell’s reputation remained tarnished by the scandal.</p><p>Australia’s Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse found that he knew of clergy molesting children in the 1970s and did not take adequate action to address it.</p><p>Pell later said in a statement he was “surprised” by the commission’s findings. “These views are not supported by evidence,” Pell’s statement said.</p><p>With his rather brusque, no-nonsense Australian sensibilities, Pell clashed frequently with the Vatican’s Italian old guard during the three years he worked to get a handle on the Vatican’s assets and spending. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sexual-abuse-by-clergy-australia-george-pell-pope-francis-sexual-abuse-f2c5b3129f51c96f9960affa8b0b904f">He was vindicated</a> when Vatican prosecutors put 10 people, including his onetime nemesis, on trial in 2021 for a host of alleged financial crimes.</p><p>After Pell returned to Rome following his release from prison, he had a well-publicized private audience with Francis.</p><p>“He acknowledged what I was trying to do,” Pell said of the pope during a 2020 interview. “And, you know, I think it’s been sadly vindicated by revelations and developments.”</p><p>Francis said as much in a recent interview with Italy's Mediaset broadcaster, crediting Pell with having set the Vatican on the path of financial transparency and lamenting that he was forced to abandon the effort to face the “calumny” of the abuse charges back home.</p><p>“It was Pell who laid out how we could go forward. He's a great man and we owe him so much,” Francis said last month. </p><p>Pell was born on June 8, 1941, the eldest of three children to a heavyweight champion boxer and publican also named George Pell, an Anglican. His mother Margaret Lillian (nee Burke) was from an Irish Catholic family.</p><p>He grew up in the Victorian regional town of Ballarat. At 193 centimeters (6 foot, 4 inches) tall, he was a talented Australian Rules Footballer. He was offered a professional football contract to play for Richmond but opted for a seminary instead.</p><p>While in Melbourne, he set up the Melbourne Response which was a world-first protocol to investigate complaints of clergy sexual abuse and to compensate victims. However many abuse victims were critical of the system and of compensation payments, saying they were designed more to shield the church from litigation.</p><p>After his convictions were overturned, Pell divided his time between Sydney and Rome, where he took part in the typical life of a retired cardinal, attending Vatican events and liturgical feasts and otherwise keeping up with news of the church. </p><p>“I’ve become very Italian,” Pell told a visitor during a lull of the coronavirus pandemic, which he spent in Rome.</p><p>Pell, along with the Melbourne archdiocese, was also battling a civil case back in Australia, which lawyers said Wednesday would continue against Pell's estate.</p><p>That case was brought by the father of a former altar boy who claimed he was sexually abused by Pell. The father claims he suffered psychological effects from the abuse of his son, who died in 2014 from an accidental drug overdose.</p><p>“A civil trial likely would have provided the opportunity to cross examine Pell, and truly test his defense against these allegations," said Lisa Flynn, the chief legal officer of Shine Lawyers. “There is still a great deal of evidence for this claim to rely on.”</p><p>A requiem Mass would be celebrated in Rome, but Pell was expected to be buried in Sydney.</p><p>___</p><p>McGuirk reported from Canberra, Australia, and Perry from Wellington, New Zealand.</p>]]></description>

(FBI via AP, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>BOSTON (AP) — Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's attorney urged a federal appeals court Tuesday to throw out the 29-year-old’s death sentence because of juror misconduct claims just months after it <a href="https://apnews.com/article/bombings-dzhokhar-tsarnaev-e52706c006644cfcb3f742cf78afa6d0">was revived by the nation’s highest court.</a></p><p>Tsarnaev is making a renewed push to avoid execution after the Supreme Court last year reinstated the death sentence imposed on him for his role in the bombing that killed three people and injured hundreds near the finish line of the marathon in 2013. </p><p>His lawyers are now challenging issues that weren't considered by the Supreme Court, including whether the trial judge wrongly denied his challenge of two jurors who defense attorneys say lied during jury selection questioning.</p><p>One juror said she had not commented about the case online but had retweeted a post calling Tsarnaev a “piece of garbage." Another juror said none of his Facebook friends had commented on the trial, even though one had urged him to “play the part” so he could get on the jury and send Tsarnaev to “jail where he will be taken of,” defense attorneys say. Tsarnaev's lawyers raised those concerns during jury selection, but the judge chose not to look into them further, they say. </p><div id="afs:Card:827068831206" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="f32276fbfccb77fca2a08ae831d7f4df">Hub peek embed (Crime) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“This case was tried in Boston on a promise ... that despite the extraordinary impact of the marathon bombing on this community,” a through questioning of potential jurors would remove anyone unqualified, Tsarnaev attorney Daniel Habib told the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judges. “That promise was not kept.” </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The Justice Department has continued to push to uphold Tsarnaev’s sentence even after Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2021 <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-executions-government-and-politics-9daf230ef2257b901cb0dfeeeb60be44">imposed a moratorium on federal executions</a> while the department conducts a review of its policies and procedures. The department has not indicated how long it might maintain the hold, which came after former President Donald Trump administration’s put to death 13 inmates in its final six months.</p><p>President Joe Biden has said that he opposes the death penalty and will work to end its use, but he has taken no action to do so while in office. And the moratorium doesn't prevent federal prosecutors from seeking the death penalty, as they are in the case of a man <a href="https://apnews.com/article/islamic-state-group-crime-legal-proceedings-manhattan-new-york-city-b4f61fd689c53614dd3e4c954c57d23f">currently on trial for killing eight people</a> on a New York City bike path in 2017. </p><p>William Glaser, a Justice Department lawyer, said the trial judge did nothing wrong in his handling of the jurors. Glaser acknowledged that the jurors made inaccurate statements but said other disclosures they made to the court suggest they were merely misremembering. </p><p>“There is no indication in this record that the inaccuracies were the kind of knowing dishonesty that would lead to disqualification,” Glaser said. </p><p>But Judge William Kayatta Jr. questioned how the trial judge could know that without looking further into Tsarnaev's claims. And Judge O. Rogeriee Thompson told the Justice Department lawyer she found it difficult to see how Tsarnaev can't at least plausibly claim that the juror told to “play the part” was knowingly lying.</p><p>“If, for instance, the Facebook friend had said 'get on the jury and make sure that the death penalty isn't imposed,' it's hard for me to believe that you wouldn't be in here arguing the opposite of what you are arguing now,'" she told Glaser. </p><p>Some survivors of the bombing who attended the hearing met briefly with Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins afterward outside the courtroom. Marc Fucarile, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/science-health-boston-marathon-bombing-marathons-bombings-0a3f077118a341b9bf59f3645ed4f6d6">who lost a leg and suffered other serious injuries</a> in the blast, said he came to the arguments to let the judges know survivors are “still paying attention to what they are doing.” </p><p>“At a certain point we need to draw a line in the sand and say enough is enough. It is not in question what he did,” Fucarile told The Associated Press. </p><p>Tsarnaev’s lawyers acknowledged at the very beginning of his trial that he and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, set off the two bombs that killed Lingzi Lu, a 23-year-old Boston University graduate student from China; Krystle Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager from Medford, Massachusetts; and 8-year-old Martin Richard, of Boston. </p><p>They have argued, however, that he shouldn't be put to death, saying his brother radicalized him and was the mastermind of the attack. </p><p>Tsarnaev was convicted in 2015 of all 30 charges against him, including conspiracy and use of a weapon of mass destruction and the killing of Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Officer Sean Collier during the Tsarnaev brothers’ getaway attempt. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died in a gunbattle with police a few days after the April 15, 2013, bombing. </p><p>The 1st Circuit in 2020 overturned Tsarnaev's death sentence and ordered a new penalty-phase trial to decide whether he should be executed, finding that the judge did not sufficiently questioning jurors about their exposure to extensive news coverage of the bombing. But the Supreme Court justices, by a 6-3 vote, agreed with the Biden administration that the 1st Circuit's ruling was wrong.</p><p>____</p><p>This story has been corrected to reflect that the federal moratorium was put in place in 2021, not last year. </p>]]></description>

(Jan. 10) (AP video: Teresa Crawford, Carrie Antlfinger)</p>    <p>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Chickens may not be able to fly very far, but the price of eggs is soaring.</p><p>A lingering bird flu outbreak, combined with soaring feed, fuel and labor costs, has led to U.S. egg prices more than doubling over the past year, and hatched a lot of sticker shock on grocery aisles.</p><p>The national average price for a dozen eggs hit $3.59 in November, up from $1.72 a year earlier, according to the latest government data. That's putting stress on consumer budgets and the bottom lines of restaurants, bakeries and other food producers that rely heavily on eggs.</p><div class="social-embed" id="se2:a27fce20-7820-11ed-9f90-b7bb8d9b59aa"><iframe title="Egg prices soared in 2022" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="ap-chart-QPLRo" src="https://interactives.ap.org/embeds/QPLRo/3/" scrolling="no" width="100%" style="border:none" height="400" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe><p class="social-caption"> </p></div><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/thanksgiving-food-prices-inflation-d02949df4706751234e72b5715fa0030">Grocery prices</a> that were up 12% in November are driving <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-taiwan-economy-federal-reserve-system-mark-zandi-81d06279f6b03c8e9e096226d95552da">inflation higher,</a> even though the overall pace of price increases <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-november-report-c3764250d475b1149d344462adff53d6">slowed a bit through the fall</a> as gas prices eased.</p><p>But egg prices are up significantly more than other foods — even more than chicken or turkey — because egg farmers were hit harder by the bird flu. More than 43 million of the 58 million <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-business-iowa-bird-flu-4c49e56a8c84c425c308e97617e31066">birds slaughtered</a> over the past year to control the virus have been egg-laying chickens, including some farms with more than a million birds apiece in major egg-producing states <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-iowa-des-moines-flu-us-department-of-agriculture-822360c4db84ca9917ac615b760b2b53">like Iowa</a>.</p><p>Everyone who approaches the egg case a Hy-Vee grocery store in Omaha, “has a sour face,” said shopper Nancy Stom.</p><div id="afs:Card:604728406135" content-id="213d845ae92814bf3189eec9c1ccf902" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (apf-business) - Compressed layout (automatic embed)</div><p>But even with the cost increases, eggs remain relatively cheap compared to the price of other proteins like chicken or beef, with a pound of chicken breasts going for $4.42 on average in November and a pound of ground beef selling for $4.85, according to the <a href="https://ag.purdue.edu/cfdas/resource-library/average-food-prices/">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.</p><p>“It’s still an inexpensive meal,” Stom said. But the 70-year-old said that at these prices, she’ll watch her eggs more closely in the fridge and try not to let them go bad before they get used.</p><p>If prices remain this high, Kelly Fischer said she will start thinking more seriously about building a backyard chicken coop in Chicago because everyone in her family eats eggs. </p><p>“We (with neighbors) are contemplating building a chicken coop behind our houses, so eventually I hope not to buy them and have my own eggs and I think the cost comes into that somewhat," the 46-year-old public school teacher said while shopping at HarvesTime Foods on the city’s North Side. “For me, it’s more of the environmental impact and trying to purchase locally."</p><div id="86ce07735129498085ed30c28d871852" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>In some places, it can even be hard to find eggs on the shelves. But egg supplies overall are holding up because the total flock is only down about 5% from from its normal size of around 320 million hens. Farmers have been working to replace their flocks as soon as they can after an outbreak.</p><p>Jakob Werner, 18, said he tries to find the cheapest eggs he can because he eats five or six of them a day while he’s trying to gain weight and build muscle.</p><p>“For a while, I just stopped eating eggs as they got more expensive. But since they’re my favorite food, I came back to them in the end,” said Werner, who lives in Chicago. “So I think for like a few months I just stopped eating eggs, waited for the price to come down. It never did. So now I’m buying again.”</p><p>Purdue University agricultural economist Jayson Lusk said he believes the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-flu-prices-animals-1ec0f5a8e5485300fe117f87f8470f06">bird flu outbreak</a> is the biggest driver in the price increases. Unlike past years, the virus lingered throughout the summer and made a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-minnesota-animals-flu-animal-2f02b2d35e82feb05273d9a72e898170">resurgence last fall</a> infecting egg and poultry farms.</p><div class="social-embed" id="se0:5c672a00-7820-11ed-deb0-6707804ebdee"><iframe title="U.S. egg production" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="ap-chart-0u4ZR" src="https://interactives.ap.org/embeds/0u4ZR/7/" scrolling="no" width="100%" style="border:none" height="400" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe><p class="social-caption"> </p></div><p>“Bird flu is not the only factor, but in my view it’s the main driver of what we’re experiencing at the moment,” Lusk said.</p><p>But the president and CEO of the American Egg Board trade group, Emily Metz, said she believes all the cost increases farmers have faced in the past year were a bigger factor in the price increases than bird flu.</p><p>“When you’re looking at fuel costs go up, and you’re looking at feed costs go up as much as 60%, labor costs, packaging costs — all of that ... those are much much bigger factors than bird flu for sure,” Metz said.</p><p>Jada Thomson, a University of Arkansas agricultural economist, said there may be some relief coming in egg prices in the next couple months because egg farmers have been steadily replacing their flocks lost to bird flu last year and demand will ease a bit now that people are done with their holiday baking. </p><p>But she said bird flu remains a wildcard that could still drive prices higher if there are more sizeable outbreaks at egg farms.</p><p>Farmers are <a href="https://apnews.com/article/science-health-business-iowa-agriculture-f5a5c6fbf1d6b551413fb249086fdbec">doing all they can</a> to limit the spread, but the disease is easily spread by migrating wild birds and the virus can be picked up on clothing or vehicles.</p><p>“But there are some things that are just outside of our control,” Thompson said. “You can’t control nature sometimes.”</p><p>Food producers and restaurants are hurting because it's hard to find a good substitute for eggs in their recipes. </p><p>Any decrease in egg prices would be welcome at Patti Stobaugh's two restaurants and two bakeries in Conway and Russelville, Arkansas, because all of her ingredients and supplies are more expensive these days. For some of her baked goods, Stobaugh has switched to a frozen egg product that's not quite as pricey, but she's still buying eggs for all the breakfasts she serves. </p><p>A case of 15 dozen eggs has gone from $36 to $86 over the last year, but flour, butter, chicken and everything else she buys is also more expensive. Stobaugh said that has her “hyper vigilant about every little item.”</p><p>She's already increased her prices 8% in the past year, and she may have to soon increase them again. It's a delicate balance of trying not to make it too expensive for people to eat out and hurting sales, but she doesn't have much choice while trying to provide for her 175 employees.</p><p>“We have a lot of employees that work for us and we’re responsible for making payroll every week and supporting their families. We take that very seriously. But it certainly has been tough,” Stobaugh said.</p><div class="social-embed" id="se1:7d35c110-7820-11ed-83b4-6575df0884d6"><iframe title="Demand for eggs increased in 2022" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="ap-chart-y62hV" src="https://interactives.ap.org/embeds/y62hV/4/" scrolling="no" width="100%" style="border:none" height="400" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe><p class="social-caption"> </p></div>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Eraldo Peres, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>MIAMI (AP) — The Biden administration is under growing pressure from leftists in Latin America as well as U.S. lawmakers to expel Jair Bolsonaro from a post-presidential retreat in Florida following his supporters' brazen attack on Brazil's capital over the weekend.</p><p>But the far-right ex-president may pre-empt any plans for such a stinging rebuke. On Tuesday, he told a Brazilian media outlet that he would push up his return home, originally scheduled for late January, after being hospitalized with abdominal pains stemming from a 2018 stabbing.</p><p>“I came to spend some time away with my family but these weren’t calm days,” Bolsonaro told CNN’s Portuguese-language affiliate in Brazil. “First, there was this sad episode in Brazil and then my hospitalization.” </p><p>Bolsonaro arrived in Florida in late December, skipping the Jan. 1 swearing-in of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who became the first elected Brazilian president not to receive the presidential sash from his predecessor since democracy was restored in the 1980s. Bolsonaro is reportedly staying at the Orlando-area home of Brazilian mixed martial arts fighter Jose Aldo, a fervent supporter. </p><p>His visit to the Sunshine state went largely unnoticed in the U.S. until Sunday's attack by thousands of die-hard supporters who had been camping for weeks outside a military base in Brasilia, refusing to accept Bolsonaro's narrow defeat in an October runoff. Their invasion of Brazil’s congress and presidential palace left behind shattered glass, smashed computers and slashed artwork.</p><div id="afs:Card:347160095803" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="5d5f0fb703ddc7de29fdad93a0149435">Hub peek embed (JairBolsonaro) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Almost from the moment the images of destruction were broadcast to the world, Democrats voiced concern about Bolsonaro’s continued presence on U.S. soil, drawing parallels between the rampage in Brazil and the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection by allies of Donald Trump who stormed the Capitol to try to overturn the U.S. presidential election results.</p><p>Among those calling for President Joe Biden to give Bolsonaro the boot was Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p><p>“Nearly two years to the day the U.S. Capitol was attacked by fascists, we see fascist movements abroad attempt to do the same in Brazil,” the New York City lawmaker said. “The U.S. must cease granting refuge to Bolsonaro in Florida.”</p><p>It should be a no brainer for the White House, experts say. </p><p>Biden has never had a close relationship with Bolsonaro, who made common cause with Trump's top allies on the far right. And any action to expel him is likely to play well in Latin America, where Biden is courting a crop of new leftist leaders who have risen to power in places like Chile and Colombia expressing similar concerns about threats to democracy.</p><p>“It’s one thing to make statements about support for democracy,” said John Feeley, a longtime U.S. diplomat in Latin America who resigned as ambassador to Panama in 2018 over differences with the Trump administration. </p><p>“It’s another to actually take action in your own home, where you have sovereign control, with someone who is clearly in league with the same folks who brought you Jan. 6,” Feeley said.</p><p>But so far the Biden administration has proceeded cautiously. </p><p>On Monday, State Department spokesman Ned Price, while sidestepping questions about Bolsonaro's presence, said anyone entering the U.S. on a so-called A-1 visa reserved for sitting heads of state would have 30 days to either leave the country or adjust their status with the Department of Homeland Security at the conclusion of their term of office.</p><p>Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, was similarly circumspect, saying only that any request from Brazil’s government related to Bolsonaro would be evaluated, taking into consideration legal precedent. Typically, the U.S. is reluctant to discuss visa issues out of privacy concerns.</p><p>Feeley said the longer the Biden administration waits the weaker its support for democracy will be perceived in the region.</p><p>One place Bolsonaro apparently isn't going is Italy. The former president is the descendant of 19th-century immigrants from northern Italy and Brazilian media had speculated for months that he and his children would seek Italian citizenship out of fear he could be prosecuted in Brazil for corruption or his mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic. </p><p>But Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani told state radio on Tuesday that Bolsonaro has never requested citizenship — despite being bestowed honorary citizenship in 2021 by the small town where his great-grandfather was born. </p><p>“There are laws that address who gets citizenship,″ Tajani said, emphasizing his far-right-led government’s strong condemnation of the raid on Brazilian government institutions by Bolsonaro supporters. "It is not a political, discretionary choice.”</p><p>—-</p><p>AP Writers Matt Lee in Washington and Colleen Barry in Milan contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

George Santos, the newly-elected Republican from New York who admitted to lying about his resume and personal history during his run for the House.</p>    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The House Ethics Committee was asked Tuesday to investigate <a href="https://apnews.com/article/george-santos-house-of-representatives-d65613ce8bcda757bf3b89c3d0fcfa82">Rep. George Santos</a>, the newly-elected Republican from New York who has admitted to lying about his job experience, college education and even family heritage, and now faces questions about his campaign financial disclosures.</p><p>Two Democrats requested the probe, saying Santos “has failed to uphold the integrity expected of members of the House of Representatives.” </p><p>In a letter to the Ethics Committee, Democratic Reps. Ritchie Torres and Dan Goldman, both of New York, said Santos also failed to file “timely, accurate and complete” financial disclosure reports as required by law. They said the reports Santos did file are “sparse and perplexing.” They asked the panel to investigate and “take appropriate action as soon as possible.”</p><p>Some Democratic leaders said Santos should be expelled from the House.</p><p>A spokesperson for Santos did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-business-bb455cc02b70e5366b9c5e347da8ad38">Santos has admitted to fabricating</a> several aspects of his life story and experience in his run for the House seat that he won in November, helping to give <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-house-of-representatives-kevin-mccarthy-us-republican-party-0938c7358f41c83759246f8949ac7c15?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=TopNews&amp;utm_campaign=position_01">Republicans a narrow majority.</a> Nevertheless, the newly-elected lawmaker was sworn into office last week alongside all other members of the House.</p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="17bfaa6420fb5bf1f8b0c20ffbeac2e9">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Republican leaders have refused to take action against Santos, whose election helped give them a 222-seat hold on the House majority. Santos also voted last week in the raucous balloting to make <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-house-of-representatives-kevin-mccarthy-government-e986c620149b72030bb418bd5fadb4a2">GOP leader Kevin McCarthy the House speaker.</a></p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Majority Leader Steve Scalise said Tuesday the situation is being “handled internally” by Republicans. </p><p>“Obviously there were concerns about what we had heard,” said Scalise, R-La. “So we’re gonna have to sit down and talk to him about it.”</p><p>Santos admitted two weeks ago that he lied about his job experience and college education during his successful campaign for a seat in the U.S. House.</p><p>Santos had also said he had worked for Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, but neither company could find any records verifying that.</p><p>In an interview with the New York Post, Santos said: “My sins here are embellishing my resume. I’m sorry.”</p><div id="8c51f3ca85b04a2f8b02981917db5bcd" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>He also explained that he never claimed to be Jewish after the Jewish American site The Forward had questioned a claim on Santos’ campaign website that his grandparents “fled Jewish persecution in Ukraine, settled in Belgium, and again fled persecution during WWII.”</p><p>Democrats were scathing in their criticism.</p><p>“Kevin McCarthy owns George Santos, lock stop and barrel," said Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus. “It’s the only reason why he was seated, to give George Santos that ability to vote for Kevin McCarthy. So let’s call this exactly what it is. There should be repercussions.”</p><p>It's unclear the Ethics Committee's next steps. As part of the new House rules package, any member of the public can now file complaints against lawmakers. Ethics advocates have warned other new rules will weaken the committee's staff and membership.</p><p>The committee has not fully formed yet as House Republicans are in the midst of choosing committee chairs, members and setting up the new Congress.</p>]]></description>

The contract could be worth $225 million over seven seasons, $245 million over eight years and $260 million over nine seasons.</p><p>Correa's options also could be triggered by a top-five finish in MVP voting, a Silver Slugger award or World Series or League Championship Series MVP. He gets a no-trade provision.</p><p>New York's deal guaranteed $157.5 million over the first six seasons, the person said.</p><p>Following Correa's December physical for New York, Mets chief legal officer Katie Pothier proposed that Correa be subject to an annual physical starting after the 2028 season.

Dr. Kevin Varner, chairman of the Department of Orthopedics at Houston Methodist Hospital, operated on Correa.</p><p>Boras in prior years had worked out medical issues in contracts for Ivan Rodriguez and Magglio Ordóñez with Detroit and for J.D. Drew and J.D.

(Jan. 10)</p>    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden said he was surprised when informed that government records were found by his attorneys at his former office space in Washington. He was asked about the issue after the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee requested that the U.S. intelligence community conduct a “damage assessment” of potentially classified documents.</p><p>Speaking to reporters in Mexico City on Tuesday, Biden said his attorneys “did what they should have done” when they immediately called the National Archives about the discovery at the offices of the Penn Biden Center. He kept an office there after he left the vice presidency in 2017 until shortly before he launched his Democratic presidential campaign in 2019.</p><p>The White House confirmed that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-united-states-government-812ef44a5333f6d93423a67a683fa024">the Department of Justice was reviewing</a> “a small number of documents with classified markings" found at the office.</p><p>“I was briefed about this discovery and surprised to learn that there are any government records that were taken there to that office,” Biden said in his first comments since news of the Nov. 2, 2022, document discovery emerged Monday. He added that “I don’t know what’s in the documents" and that his lawyers had suggested he not ask.</p><div id="afs:Card:130243251955" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="a45855907a73acb256bb7c4dd5a91610">Hub peek embed (JoeBiden) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Earlier Tuesday, Rep. Mike Turner sent the request to Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, saying that Biden's retention of the documents put him in “potential violation of laws protecting national security, including the Espionage Act and Presidential Records Act.”</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Irrespective of a federal review, the revelation that Biden potentially mishandled classified or presidential records could prove to be a political headache for the president, who called former President Donald Trump’s decision to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-mar-a-lago-national-security-9c1f6dca7e3e8073ee029604c8253a5c">keep hundreds of such records</a> at his private club in Florida “irresponsible.”</p><p>“Those entrusted with access to classified information have a duty and an obligation to protect it,” said Turner in a letter to Haines. “This issue demands a full and thorough review.”</p><p>On Tuesday, Rep. James Comer, the new GOP chairman of the House Oversight Committee, sent the White House Counsel’s office a letter requesting copies of the documents found at the Biden office, communications about the discovery, and a list of those who may have had access to the office where they were found. The White House didn’t immediately respond to the request.</p><div id="6792525ccb844458a449b2d7bbd56262" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Haines agreed in September to conduct a “risk assessment” rather than a “damage assessment” of the Trump case.</p><p>There are <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-classified-documents-trump-side-by-side-fb2c4ebccdbdbb9039c1c5e227b1da53">significant differences between the Trump and Biden situations</a>, including the gravity of an ongoing grand jury investigation into the Mar-a-Lago matter. The intelligence risk assessment into the Trump documents is to examine the seized records for classification as well as “the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of the relevant documents.”</p><p>Sen. Mark Warner, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called for a briefing on the documents.</p><p>“Our system of classification exists in order to protect our most important national security secrets, and we expect to be briefed on what happened both at Mar-a-Lago and at the Biden office as part of our constitutional oversight obligations," he said. "From what we know so far, the latter is about finding documents with markings, and turning them over, which is certainly different from a months-long effort to retain material actively being sought by the government. But again, that’s why we need to be briefed."</p><p>Special counsel to the president Richard Sauber said Monday that after Biden's attorneys found the records, they notified the National Archives and Records Administration — which took custody of the documents the next day. </p><p>“Since that discovery, the President’s personal attorneys have cooperated with the Archives and the Department of Justice in a process to ensure that any Obama-Biden Administration records are appropriately in the possession of the Archives,” Sauber said. </p><p>A person who is familiar with the matter but not authorized to discuss it publicly said Attorney General Merrick Garland asked U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois John Lausch to review the matter after the Archives referred the issue to the department. Lausch is one of the few U.S. attorneys to be held over from Trump's administration. </p><p>Trump weighed in Monday on his social media site, asking, “When is the FBI going to raid the many homes of Joe Biden, perhaps even the White House?”</p><p>Republicans have just taken control of the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-us-republican-party-united-states-house-of-representatives-kevin-mccarthy-b9fcfd11427a695fe2eb49e36988f1a0">House of Representatives</a> and are promising to launch widespread investigations of Biden's administration.</p><p>The revelation also may complicate the Justice Department's consideration of whether to bring charges against Trump, a Republican who is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-2024-updates-cd5339d48064a149527e8f9a1aa7614e">trying to win back the White House</a> in 2024 and has repeatedly claimed the department's inquiry into of his own conduct amounted to “corruption."</p><p>The National Archives did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. Spokespeople for Garland and Lausch declined to comment. </p><p>Comer also sent <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2023-01-10-Letter-NARA-Biden-classified-docs.pdf">a letter</a> to the National Archives requesting records and correspondence relating to discovery of the Biden documents, asserting that “NARA’s inconsistent treatment of recovering classified records held by former President Trump and President Biden raises questions about political bias at the agency.”</p><p>His Democratic counterpart, Rep. Jamie Raskin, said Biden's attorneys “appear to have taken immediate and proper action.”</p><p>“I have confidence that the attorney general took the appropriate steps to ensure the careful review of the circumstances surrounding the possession and discovery of these documents and make an impartial decision about any further action that may be needed,” he added.</p><p>Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, chair of the powerful House Judiciary Committee, said Monday that the American public deserved to know earlier about the classified documents.</p><p>“They knew about this a week before the election, maybe the American people should have known that,” Jordan told reporters. “They certainly knew about the the raid on Mar-a-Lago 91 days before this election, but nice if on November 2, the country would have known that there were classified documents at the Biden Center.”</p><p>Jordan is among House Republicans pushing for the creation of a “select subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal government” within the Judiciary Committee.</p><p>It wasn't immediately clear why the White House didn't disclose the discovery of the documents or the DOJ review sooner. CBS was first to report Monday on the discovery of the potentially classified documents.</p><p>The Justice Department for months has been investigating the retention of roughly 300 documents that were marked as classified and were recovered from <a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-america-donald-trump-mar-a-lago-ap-top-news-politics-993263aaefab49a7988bb4ccb808791d">Trump's Florida estate</a>. In that instance, prosecutors say, representatives of Trump resisted requests to give back the full stash of classified documents and failed to fully comply with a subpoena that sought their return.</p><p>FBI agents in August served a search warrant at the Mar-a-Lago property, removing 33 boxes and containers.</p><p>That investigation is being led by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jack-smith-special-counsel-prosecutor-donald-trump-garland-e1fdb71cfc258bc2be48a8b890a9269b">special counsel Jack Smith</a>. Prosecutors have interviewed an array of Trump associates and have been using a grand jury to hear evidence.</p><p>Democrats made a similar request of the director of national intelligence in August following the search of Mar-a-Lago. Reps. Carolyn Maloney and Adam Schiff, who then led the House Oversight and Intelligence committees, asked Haines for an “immediate review and damage assessment,” alleging that Trump “has potentially put our national security at grave risk.”</p><p>Intelligence officials are not believed to have briefed Congress on their assessment in the four months since, according to public statements from lawmakers. Haines noted in her letter that any risk assessment would not “unduly interfere” with the Justice Department’s criminal investigation into the documents seized at Mar-a-Lago.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Nomaan Merchant, Eric Tucker and Farnoush Amiri in Washington, Colleen Long in Mexico City and Michael Tarm in Chicago contributed.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, Pool, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic Rep. Katie Porter of California said Tuesday she will seek the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Sen. <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/dianne-feinstein">Dianne Feinstein</a>, a fellow Democrat and the oldest member of the chamber. </p><p>“Especially in times like these, California needs a warrior in Washington," Porter said in a video posted on Twitter. “That's exactly why I'm announcing my candidacy for the United States Senate in 2024.” </p><p>Porter is a progressive Democrat who was first elected to Congress in 2018 and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-california-cd03ac6217b63f76c5a954961bf0fbf2">won a tight race for reelection</a> to her newly redrawn Southern California district in November. She said in the video that she has “challenged the status quo" in Washington, taking on “big banks,” Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry. She wants to ban members of Congress from stock trading. </p><p>“To win these fights, it's time for new leadership in the U.S. Senate," she said.</p><p>Feinstein, 89, has for several years faced questions about her health and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/confirmation-hearings-amy-coney-barrett-dianne-feinstein-elections-california-bef21dcb7dbc3d222dc6c95a165fff71">whether she will seek another term</a>. She has not announced whether she will seek reelection in 2024, though she is widely expected to retire.</p><p>“Everyone is of course welcome to throw their hat in the ring, and I will make an announcement concerning my plans for 2024 at the appropriate time," Feinstein, who won her sixth election in 2018 said in a statement Tuesday. She added that she is currently “focused on ensuring California has all the resources it needs” to deal with <a href="https://apnews.com/article/floods-weather-natural-disasters-landslides-and-mudslides-storms-21b103e791710f4af6ca0ce45c6030b5?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=TopNews&amp;utm_campaign=position_02">deadly storms hitting the state</a>.</p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="172759fa83faa0a70a2195a91dedb6f3">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Porter’s announcement, which came as torrential rains and mudslides forced thousands from their homes and were blamed for the deaths of over a dozen people, could be the start of a competitive race between multiple candidates in the heavily Democratic state. Republicans haven’t won a statewide race in California since 2006, and with Feinstein and Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer having their seats locked up for a quarter century, several Democrats have been waiting for their chance. </p><p>Among the potential candidates is Rep. Adam Schiff, who was a key figure in impeachment proceedings against former President Donald Trump and has said he's exploring a Senate run. Rep. Ro Khanna told NBC News on Tuesday that he is focused on “historic weather conditions” his district is facing and that he will make a decision “in the next few months.”</p><p>Feinstein was elected for the sixth time in 2018. Noticeably more frail than in previous years and occasionally forgetful when asked questions, she holds no senior leadership positions, makes fewer public appearances and is no longer the force she was in the Senate. She stepped down from her post as the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee in 2020 and also declined to take the post of Senate pro tempore this year after the retirement of Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy.</p><p>The Senate president pro tempore, third in line to the presidency, usually goes automatically to the most senior member of the majority party. As the de facto president of the Senate when the vice president is away, the president pro tempore has several jobs, including opening the Senate every day that it is in session.</p><p>While Feinstein is the most senior Senate Democrat, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer gave the post to Washington Sen. Patty Murray after Feinstein indicated she would not take it. In a statement released by a spokesman last year, she said “I’ve never thought about being the president pro tempore and I have no interest in it at this time.”</p><p>Feinstein also has seen pushback from Democrats who view her as too bipartisan at a time when politics is more polarized and her state is increasingly liberal. She was criticized in 2020 for being too friendly with Republicans during confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett. That included <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-confirmation-hearings-amy-coney-barrett-dianne-feinstein-voting-rights-366d70dcde6aa681e540dd6a0e3a25de">an embrace</a> of the Republican Chairman, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, at the conclusion of the hearings and kind words for what she called a job well done.</p><p>Feinstein has defended her performance and said in 2021 that she planned to serve her full term, even as there was open speculation and discussion about the future of the seat. Gov. Gavin Newson said in 2021 that he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/gavin-newsom-dianne-feinstein-california-351cb71e532c073f28d6d84465480cf6">would appoint a Black woman</a> to replace Feinstein, who's white, if she were to retire early.</p><p>Porter, 49, was a consumer protection attorney before her election to the House, and she has earned a reputation for her tough questioning of CEOs and other witnesses at congressional hearings — often using a whiteboard to break down information.</p><p>Porter's media savvy was again on display during the recent meltdown in the U.S. House over the election of a new speaker. As <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-kevin-mccarthy-matt-gaetz-florida-f2a4a42b4845f2413cca5c1b4c6100dd">Republicans argued</a>, Porter was seen sitting in the chamber, disinterestedly, reading a book on “the subtle art” of not caring about what's happening.</p><p>Porter also has been one of the top fundraisers in the House, having spent more than $24 million on her reelection to the House last year. The Tuesday announcement allows her to get a head start on banking money and securing donors' support. </p><p>Her opponent in the November House election, Republican Scott Baugh, said Tuesday that he will again run for the closely contested House district in 2024.</p><p>__</p><p>Burnett reported from Chicago.

(AP Photo)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran has sentenced a Belgian aid worker to a lengthy prison term and 74 lashes after convicting him of espionage in a closed-door trial, state media reported Tuesday.</p><p>The website of Iran’s judiciary said a Revolutionary Court sentenced 41-year-old Olivier Vandecasteele to 12.5 years in prison for espionage, 12.5 years for collaboration with hostile governments and 12.5 years for money laundering. He was also fined $1 million and sentenced to 2.5 years for currency smuggling.</p><p>Under Iranian law, Vandecasteele would be eligible for release after 12.5 years. The judiciary website said the verdicts can be appealed.</p><p>Iran has detained a number of foreigners and dual nationals over the years, accusing them of espionage or other state security offenses and sentencing them after secretive trials in which rights groups say they are denied due process. </p><p>Critics accuse Iran of using such prisoners as bargaining chips with the West, something Iranian officials deny. Vandecasteele's conviction comes after <a href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-trials-antwerp-france-belgium-6005db14421f60e003cfcf5a32145414">an Iranian diplomat in Belgium received a 20-year prison sentence in 2021</a> over masterminding a thwarted bomb attack against an exiled Iranian opposition group in France.</p><div id="afs:Card:961996516835" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="5ae7ee103dc4cf4e06cccf7b77c6a59c">Hub peek embed (Iran) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Iran has not released any details about the charges against Vandecasteele. It is unclear if they are related to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-morality-police-explainer-b53475eda867a4158ac5032fe1b3e62e">anti-government protests</a> that have convulsed Iran for months or <a href="https://apnews.com/article/50c3e7f6445ae99def6bdc65fbce6c42">a long-running shadow war</a> with Israel and the U.S. marked by covert attacks on Iran's disputed nuclear program.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The nationwide protests began after the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was detained for allegedly violating Iran's strict Islamic dress code. Rallying under the slogan “Women, life, freedom,” the protesters say they are fed up with decades of social and political repression. Iran has blamed the protests on foreign powers, without providing evidence.</p><p>Vandecasteele's family said last month that he has been detained in an Iranian prison for months and has been on a hunger strike. They said he was deprived of access to a lawyer of his choice and is suffering from serious health problems.</p><p>Belgium <a href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-prisons-3a5d5e6d70fb654ff1829100a32ef87c">has urged its nationals to leave Iran</a>, warning that they face the risk of arbitrary arrest or unfair trial.</p><p>“Iran has provided no official information regarding the charges against Olivier Vandecasteele or his trial,” Belgium's Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib said in a statement. “We will summon the Iranian ambassador today, given the information that is circulating in the press.”</p><p>“Belgium continues to condemn this arbitrary detention and is doing everything possible to put an end to it and to improve the conditions of his detention,” she said.</p><p>The anti-government protests, which have continued for nearly four months with no sign of ending, are one of the biggest challenges to the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution that brought it to power.</p><p>At least 520 protesters have been killed and more than 19,300 people have been arrested, according to Human Rights Activists in Iran, a group that has been monitoring the unrest. Iranian authorities have not provided official figures on deaths or arrests.</p><p>Iran has executed four people after convicting them of charges linked to the protests, including attacks on security forces. They were convicted in Revolutionary Courts, which do not allow those on trial to pick their own lawyers or see the evidence against them. </p><p>London-based Amnesty International has said such trials bear “no resemblance to a meaningful judicial proceeding."</p><p>Norway and Denmark summoned Iranian ambassadors this week to protest the executions and Iran's handling of the demonstrations.</p><p>"What is happening in Iran is completely unacceptable and must stop," Norway’s Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt said. “We have strongly condemned the executions. ... We have called on Iran to end the use of the death penalty and to respect human rights.”</p><p>In Denmark, Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen called the executions “completely unacceptable" and said the European Union should impose additional sanctions on Iran.</p><p>Separately on Tuesday, the state-run IRNA news agency said Iran’s intelligence ministry arrested six teams of operatives linked to Mossad, Israel's chief intelligence and secret-service agency. </p><p>Without providing evidence, the report said the spy teams planned to assassinate an unnamed high-ranking military official and had carried out several sabotage operations in the country’s big cities.</p><p>The report also said security forces identified 23 alleged members of these teams and had arrested 13 of them who were in the country.</p>]]></description>

The final Potter book, “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows," sold more than 2.5 million copies on its first day of release, in 2007.</p><p>A few stores in Britain opened at midnight to sell copies to diehard royal devotees and the merely curious. Many said they wanted to form their own opinion of the book after days of snippets and debate on news sites and television.</p><p>“I’m excited just to hear about Prince Harry’s life from Prince Harry,” said Sarah Nakana, a surveyor who bought the book at London’s Victoria station. “There’s so much misinformation, disinformation about Harry and Meghan.”</p><p>The book’s myriad <a href="https://apnews.com/article/prince-harry-spare-book-revelations-0f60db708cfc266e247c1efa7c98877b">revelations and accusations</a> have already been splashed across the media. In the ghostwritten memoir Harry, 38, recounts his grief at the death of his mother, Princess Diana, his <a href="https://apnews.com/article/prince-harry-memoir-prince-william-allegations-e32401f7e23cf38249e093dce5249523">disputes with brother Prince William</a> and frustration at the role of royal “spare” in the shadow of his elder sibling, who is heir to the British throne.</p><p>He lacerates <a href="https://apnews.com/article/king-charles-iii-princess-diana-meghan-markle-prince-harry-royalty-0f1fb22ed38f77b99970e7739ac52f98">the U.K.'s tabloid press</a> for coverage he considers prurient, intrusive and sometimes plain wrong, claims his relatives were unwelcoming to his wife Meghan and accuses members of the royal family, including his stepmother Camilla, of leaking stories to the media to burnish their own reputations.</p><p>Buckingham Palace has not commented on any of the allegations, though royal allies have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/queen-elizabeth-ii-king-charles-iii-politics-united-kingdom-prince-harry-952c0cbaa0c39d18b8338ca651b49394">pushed back</a>, largely anonymously.</p><p>Harry’s exposure of bitter divides inside the House of Windsor — alongside details of his mental health struggles, experiences with sex and drugs and decade-long military career — has generated reams of media coverage.</p><p>"Spare'' is the top-selling book on Amazon’s U.K. site and on Amazon.com in the U.S., and is already one of the year’s biggest sellers. </p><p>John Cotterill, nonfiction buyer at the Waterstones bookstore chain, told trade magazine The Bookseller that “Spare” was “one of the biggest pre-order titles of the last decade for Waterstones.” In the U.S., Barnes &amp; Noble issued a statement Tuesday citing an “exceptional" level of customer interest, although the superstore chain did not release any specific numbers.</p><p>Excitement is far from universal, however. Harry’s interview with broadcaster ITV drew 4.1 million viewers on Sunday — fewer than the 5.3 million who watched BBC drama “Happy Valley” at the same time.</p><p>Retail worker Caroline Lennon arrived at 6 a.m. Tuesday at a branch of Waterstones in central London to await its opening.</p><p>“I did expect a queue. Unfortunately, there’s no queue. I’m just by myself,” she said.</p><p>“I want to read (it) because I like the royal family and I don’t care what anybody says,” she said. “People will criticize that. I don’t care because I like the royal family, and I like Harry and Meghan.”</p><p>_____</p><p>AP National Writer Hillel Italie contributed to this report from New York.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian forces are escalating their onslaught against Ukrainian positions around the wrecked city of Bakhmut, Ukrainian officials said, bringing new levels of death and devastation in the grinding, monthslong battle for control of eastern Ukraine that is part of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-moscow-religion-orthodox-church-9bea8791e5eda36a0b01cb3b6da86bd5">Moscow's wider war</a>.</p><p>“Everything is completely destroyed. There is almost no life left,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said late Monday of the scene around Bakhmut and the nearby Donetsk province city of Soledar, known for salt mining and processing.</p><p>“The whole land near Soledar is covered with the corpses of the occupiers and scars from the strikes,” Zelenskyy said. “This is what madness looks like.”</p><p>Late Tuesday, the head of the Wagner Group, a Russian private military contractor, Dmitry Prigozhin, claimed in audio reports posted on his Russian social media platform that his forces had seized control of Soledar, with battles continuing in a “cauldron” in the city's center. Ukrainian officials did not comment on the claim, and The Associated Press was unable to verify it.</p><p>The U.K. Defense Ministry said earlier that Russian troops alongside soldiers from the Wagner Group had advanced in Soledar and “are likely in control of most of the settlement.”</p><div id="afs:Card:521103274690" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="1643b607f7424aa58637514c59e22b35">Hub peek embed (Russia-Ukraine) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>The ministry said that taking Soledar, 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of Bakhmut, was likely Moscow’s immediate military objective and part of a strategy to encircle Bakhmut. But it added that “Ukrainian forces maintain stable defensive lines in depth and control over supply routes” in the area.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>A Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Wagner Group “has moved from being a niche sideshow of Russia’s war to a major component of the conflict,” adding that its forces now make up as much as a quarter of Russian combatants.</p><p>The Kremlin, whose invasion of its neighbor 10 1/2 months ago has suffered numerous reversals, is hungry for victories. Russia illegally annexed Donetsk and three other Ukrainian provinces in September, but <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-iran-biden-education-jake-sullivan-886376045d35f9bb7bb96cc0d18a7869">its troops have struggled</a> to advance.</p><p>After Ukrainian forces recaptured the southern city of Kherson in November, the battle heated up around Bakhmut.</p><p>Ukraine's deputy defense minister, Hanna Malyar, said Russia has thrown “a large number of storm groups” into the fight for the city. “The enemy is advancing literally on the bodies of their own soldiers and is massively using artillery, rocket launchers and mortars, hitting their own troops,” she said.</p><p>Pavlo Kyrylenko, the Donetsk region's Kyiv-appointed governor, on Tuesday described the Russian attacks on Soledar and Bakhmut as relentless. </p><p>“The Russian army is reducing Ukrainian cities to rubble using all kinds of weapons in their scorched-earth tactics,” Kyrylenko said in televised remarks. “Russia is waging a war without rules, resulting in civilian deaths and suffering.”</p><p>Wounded soldiers arrive around the clock for emergency treatment at a Ukrainian medical stabilization center near the front line around Bakhmut. Medics fought for 30 minutes Monday to save a soldier, but his injuries were too severe.</p><p>Another soldier suffered a head injury after a fragment pierced his helmet. Medics quickly stabilized him enough to transfer him to a military hospital.</p><p>“We fight to the end to save a life,” Kostyantyn Vasylkevich, a surgeon and the center’s coordinator, told The Associated Press. “Of course, it hurts when it is not possible to save them.”</p><p>The Moscow-backed leader of the occupied areas of Donetsk, Denis Pushilin, told Russian state TV control over the city would create “good prospects” for taking over Bakhmut, as well as Siversk, a town further north where <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-military-technology-ukraine-government-russia-war-2d59aae94a7ad8a5c22083e77d699417">Ukrainian fortifications</a> "are also quite serious.” </p><p>An exceptional feature of the fighting near Bakhmut is that some of it has taken place around entrances to disused salt mine tunnels which run for some 200 kilometers (120 miles), the British intelligence report noted.</p><p>“Both sides are likely concerned that (the tunnels) could be used for infiltration behind their lines,” it said.</p><p>In Russia, two signs emerged Tuesday that officials were grappling with the military shortcomings revealed during the conflict in Ukraine. </p><p>Russian Defense Minister Shoigu, whose performance has been fiercely criticized in some Russian circles but who has retained Russian President Vladimir Putin’s confidence, said Tuesday that his military would use its experience in Ukraine to improve combat training. </p><p>Military communications and control systems will be improved using artificial intelligence, Shoigu said, and troops will be given better tactical gear and equipment.</p><p>The second indication of trouble involves Russia's production of weapons and other supplies its military needs for the fight in Ukraine. The deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, warned that officials who failed to meet deadlines for such items could face criminal charges. </p><p>Putin appointed Medvedev last month to head a new commission tasked with trying to solve the military's supply problems. Numerous reports have suggested Russia is running low on certain weapons and was sending some troops into battle with insufficient equipment and clothing. </p><p>Part of the Kremlin's challenge is keeping up with the weapons and supplies that Western allies are providing to Ukraine. </p><p>The Patriot surface-to-air guided missile defense system is one of the weapons Ukraine is about to receive, and the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-politics-6bb6e815e77b0d6b83590d344eb884bb">Pentagon announced Tuesday</a> that about 100 Ukrainian troops will head to Oklahoma’s Fort Sill as soon as next week to begin training on it. That will help Ukraine protect itself against Russian missile attacks. The United States pledged one Patriot battery last month, and Germany has pledged an additional system.</p><p>Germany's foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, announced Tuesday while visiting Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv, that her country would also provide 40 million euros ($43 million) to help with demining, energy infrastructure and internet connections, German news agency dpa reported. </p><p>Several front-line cities in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk provinces have witnessed intense fighting in recent months.</p><p>Together, the provinces make up the Donbas, a broad industrial region bordering Russia that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-politics-government-milorad-dodik-7edc18d0133bbde4c5b84879c0dbe724">Putin</a> identified as a focus from the war’s outset and where Moscow-backed separatists have fought since 2014.</p><p>Russia’s grinding eastern offensive captured almost all of Luhansk during the summer. Donetsk escaped the same fate, and the Russian military subsequently poured manpower and resources around Bakhmut.</p><p>Taking Bakhmut would disrupt Ukraine’s supply lines and open a route for Russian forces to press toward Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, key Ukrainian strongholds in Donetsk. </p><p>Like Mariupol and other contested cities, Bakhmut endured a long siege without water and power even before Moscow launched massive strikes to take out public utilities across Ukraine. </p><p>Kyrylenko, the Donetsk region’s governor, estimated more than two months ago that 90% of Bakhmut’s prewar population of over 70,000 had fled since Moscow focused on seizing the entire Donbas.</p><p>Ukraine’s presidential office said at least four civilians were killed and another 30 wounded in Russian shelling between Monday and Tuesday.</p><p>Vitaliy Kim, the governor of the southern Mykolaiv region, said Russian forces shelled the port of Ochakiv and the area around it late Monday and again early Tuesday. He said 15 people, including a 2-year-old child, were wounded.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP’s coverage of the war at <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine">https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine</a></p>]]></description>

(Jan.9) (AP Video/Terry Chea)</p>    <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) — Sinkholes swallowed cars and floodwaters swamped towns and swept away a small boy as California was wracked by more <a href="https://apnews.com/article/science-weather-climate-and-environment-storms-europe-819908345ed948e078d72e7de9fcd4bb">wild winter</a> while the next in a powerful string of storms loomed on the horizon Tuesday.</p><p>Millions of residents faced flood warnings, nearly 50,000 people were under evacuation orders, and more than 110,000 homes and businesses were without power because of heavy rains, lightning, hail and landslides. </p><p>At least 17 people have died from storms that began late last month, Gov. Gavin Newsom said during a visit to the scenic town of Capitola on the Santa Cruz coast that was hard hit by high surf and flooding creek waters last week. The deaths included a pickup truck driver and motorcyclist killed Tuesday morning when a eucalyptus tree fell on them on Highway 99 in the San Joaquin Valley near Visalia, the California Highway Patrol said.</p><p>“We’ve had less people die in the last two years of major wildfires in California than have died since New Year’s Day related to this weather," Newsom said. "These conditions are serious and they’re deadly.”</p><p>The storm that began Monday dumped more than a foot and a half (45 centimeters) of rain in Southern California mountains and buried Sierra Nevada ski resorts in more than 5 feet (1.5 meters) of snow. </p><p>Rockfalls and landslides shut down roads, and gushing runoff turned sections of freeways into waterways. Swollen rivers swamped homes and residents of small communities inundated with water and mud were stranded.</p><p>“We’re all stuck out here,” said Brian Briggs, after the deluge unleashed mudslides in remote Matilija Canyon that buried one house completely and cut off the only road to nearby Ojai. </p><p>Briggs described a scary night where the canyon creek began to flood people's yards and the surrounding hills — stripped of vegetation in the 2017 Thomas Fire — began to tumble down in the dark. </p><p>Mudflows dragged sheds, gazebos and outhouses into the creek, he said. After helping neighbors get to higher ground, he returned home to find his fence destroyed by waist-deep mud.</p><p>A helicopter dropped 10 sheriff's deputies Tuesday to help the residents of dozens of homes in the canyon and Briggs said he was hoping to be airlifted out. </p><p>Raging waters crested the banks of Bear Creek and flooded parts of the city of Merced and neighboring Planada, a small agricultural community along a highway leading to Yosemite National Park. </p><p>Neighborhoods were under water with cars submerged up to their roofs. Residents ordered to evacuate carried whatever they could salvage on their backs as they left in the rain. </p><p>A break in the weather Tuesday on the central coast allowed searchers near San Miguel to look for Kyle Doan, the child who vanished after he and his mother were stranded in a truck in rising waters. His mother was rescued, but Kyle was swept away, and a seven-hour search Monday turned up only one of his Nikes.</p><p>“It’s still very dangerous out there," said San Luis Obispo County sheriff’s spokesperson Tony Cipolla. "The creeks are very fast flowing.”</p><p>The wet and blustery weather left California's large homeless population in a precarious situation. At least two homeless people in Sacramento County died, and more than a dozen people were rescued from a homeless encampment on the Ventura River.</p><p>Theo Harris, who has been living on the streets of San Francisco since getting out of jail in 2016, fortified his shelter with tarps and zip ties and took in his girlfriend after her tent flooded.</p><p>“The wind has been treacherous, but you just got to bundle up and make sure you stay dry," Harris said. “Rain is part of life. It’s going to be sunny. It’s going to rain. I just got to strap my boots up and not give up."</p><p>The storms have created what Newsom called a “weather whiplash,” swinging from an epic drought to the other extreme and arriving with a fury and frequency likely to create problems well into next week.</p><p>While most of the state remains in extreme or severe drought, according to <a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?West">the U.S. Drought Monitor</a>, the state said the water content in the snowpack is more than double the average.</p><p>“It’s fair to say that what we’re seeing right now in California will certainly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/science-weather-california-droughts-storms-04a759ff7f9db227d226ce098ad62b6d">help to relieve some of the localized aspects of drought</a>, but will not resolve the long-term drought challenges,” said Rick Spinrad, administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p><p>The latest atmospheric river — a long plume of moisture stretching out into the Pacific that can drop staggering amounts of rain and snow — began easing in some areas.

(Jan. 10)</p>    <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Allen Weisselberg, a longtime executive for <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> ’s business empire, was taken into custody Tuesday to begin serving a five-month jail term for dodging taxes on $1.7 million in job perks — a punishment the judge who sentenced him said was probably too lenient for a case “driven entirely by greed.”</p><p>Weisselberg, 75, was promised the short sentence in August when he agreed to plead guilty to 15 tax crimes and to be a witness against the Trump Organization, where he worked since the mid-1980s. His testimony helped convict the former president’s company, where he had served as chief financial officer, of tax fraud.</p><p>But when he made the sentence official Tuesday, Judge Juan Manuel Merchan said that after listening to Weisselberg's trial testimony, he regretted that the penalty wasn't tougher. He said he was especially appalled by testimony that Weisselberg gave his wife a $6,000 check for a no-show job so that she could qualify for Social Security benefits.</p><p>Had he not already promised to give Weisselberg five months, Merchan said, “I would be imposing a sentence much greater than that.”</p><p>“I’m not going to deviate from the promise, though I believe a stiffer sentence is warranted, having heard the evidence,” he added.</p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="ad4cfbc71bb696b9a3fa6343de393613">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Weisselberg, who came to court dressed for jail rather than in his usual suit, was handcuffed and taken away by court officers moments after the sentence was announced. He was taken to New York City’s notorious Rikers Island complex, where he was expected to be housed in an infirmary unit. He will be eligible for release after little more than three months if he behaves behind bars.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Weisselberg's sentencing also marked the end of his career at the Trump Organization, where he had been on leave since the fall, continuing to make $1.14 million in salary and bonuses, even as he was testifying against the company. His lawyer, Nicholas Gravante, said that as of Tuesday, the executive and the company “have amicably parted ways.”</p><p>As part of the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/allen-weisselberg-trump-cfo-plea-deal-e36dbd47ee3b0323e1fa102117718011">plea agreement</a>, Weisselberg was required to pay nearly $2 million in back taxes, penalties and interest, which prosecutors said he has done. Prosecutors recommended a six-month jail sentence, but Merchan said he settled on five months, in part because of mitigating factors, such as Weisselberg’s military service and stint as a public school teacher. In addition, Merchan ordered Weisselberg to complete five years of probation after his leaves jail.</p><div id="d11635d149694a8b90904a97f7383cd1" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Gravante had asked the judge for an even lighter sentence than the one in the plea bargain, citing Weisselberg’s age and “far from perfect health."</p><p>“He has already been punished tremendously by the disgrace that he has brought not only on himself, but his wife, his sons and his grandchildren," Gravante said.</p><p>Weisselberg faced the prospect of up to 15 years in prison — the maximum punishment for the top grand larceny charge — if he were to have reneged on his deal or if he didn’t testify truthfully at the Trump Organization’s trial. Weisselberg is the only person charged in the Manhattan district attorney’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-new-york-manhattan-donald-trump-government-and-politics-af8c8d828e224dcde9b39ae17cbb3a4c">three-year investigation of Trump and his business practices</a>.</p><p>Weisselberg testified for three days, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-new-york-manhattan-donald-trump-c34f862954f07da374468d92633b2a2b">offering a glimpse into the inner workings of Trump’s real estate empire</a>. Weisselberg has worked for Trump’s family for nearly 50 years, starting as an accountant for his developer father, Fred Trump, in 1973. He joined Donald Trump in 1986 and helped expand the company into a global golf and hotel brand.</p><p>Weisselberg told jurors he betrayed the Trump family’s trust by conspiring with a subordinate to hide more than a decade’s worth of extras from his income, including a free Manhattan apartment, luxury cars and his grandchildren’s private school tuition. He said they fudged payroll records and issued falsified W-2 forms.</p><p>A Manhattan jury <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-new-york-manhattan-donald-trump-government-and-politics-86177401a887c85ab50d8b78eb1ed397">convicted the Trump Organization in December</a>, finding that Weisselberg had been a “high managerial” agent entrusted to act on behalf of the company and its various entities. Weisselberg’s arrangement reduced his own personal income taxes but also saved the company money because it didn’t have to pay him more to cover the cost of the perks.</p><p>Prosecutors said other Trump Organization executives also accepted off-the-books compensation. Weisselberg alone was accused of defrauding the federal government, state and city out of more than $900,000 in unpaid taxes and undeserved tax refunds.</p><p>The Trump Organization is scheduled to be sentenced on Friday and faces a fine of up to $1.6 million.</p><p>Weisselberg testified that neither Trump nor his family knew about the scheme as it was happening, choking up as he told jurors: “It was my own personal greed that led to this."</p><p>But prosecutors, in their closing argument, said Trump “knew exactly what was going on” and that evidence, such as a lease he signed for Weisselberg’s apartment, made clear that Trump was "explicitly sanctioning tax fraud.”</p><p>Trump Organization lawyers have said Weisselberg concocted the scheme without Trump or the Trump family’s knowledge.</p><p>Weisselberg said the Trumps remained loyal to him even as the company scrambled to end some of its dubious pay practices following Trump’s 2016 election. He said Trump’s eldest sons, entrusted to run the company while Trump was president, gave him a $200,000 raise after an internal audit found he had been reducing his salary and bonuses by the cost of the perks.</p><p>The company punished him only nominally after his arrest in July 2021, reassigning him to senior adviser and moving his office. He even celebrated his 75th birthday at Trump Tower with cake and colleagues in August, just hours after finalizing the plea agreement that ushered his transformation from loyal executive to prosecution witness and, now, jail inmate.</p><p>Rikers Island, a compound of 10 jails on a spit of land in the East River, just off the main runway at LaGuardia Airport in Queens, has been plagued in recent years by violence, inmate deaths and staggering staffing shortages.</p><p>Though just 5 miles (8 kilometers) from Trump Tower, it’s a veritable world away from the life of luxury Weisselberg schemed to build — a far cry from the gilded Fifth Avenue offices where he hatched his plot and the Hudson River-view apartment he reaped as a reward.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Michael Sisak on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/mikesisak">twitter.com/mikesisak</a> and send confidential tips by visiting <a href="https://www.ap.org/tips/">https://www.ap.org/tips/</a></p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Samantha Sorsby-Jones watched friends at her Texas high school go to great lengths to get birth control: Secretly arranging rides to clinics that didn’t require parental consent and hiding phones in bushes in case parents were tracking them.</p><p>Starting Tuesday, access to reproductive health care is likely to command fresh scrutiny before the Republican-controlled Texas Capitol, where new restrictions are on the table in the first session since a stringent statewide abortion ban took effect.</p><p>Texas' abortion ban is one of the nation's strictest, allowing no exceptions in cases of rape or incest, and Republican leaders have been noncommittal about adding carveouts over the next five months. Nationwide, reproductive rights is poised to remain a dominant issue in other U.S. statehouses, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-health-minnesota-government-and-politics-dfd82ea258e2f8544bb09cea83cabf07">where a patchwork of policies has spread</a> nationwide following the fall of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-decision-854f60302f21c2c35129e58cf8d8a7b0#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20(AP)%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Supreme,Wade.">Roe v. Wade.</a></p><p>“The right to bodily autonomy is being taken away in so many different ways, it is really devastating,” said Sorsby-Jones, 20, who as a high school student three years ago was able to get birth control at a federally funded clinic in Texas after her parents refused to help her.</p><p>But a December ruling by a federal judge in Amarillo has suddenly closed that avenue to other Texas teens. U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk ruled that allowing minors to obtain free birth control without parental consent at federally funded clinics, under a program known as Title X, violated parental rights and state law.</p><div id="afs:Card:959349253064" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="7ba70ebde39cb2d992eeb7e5f32603ca">Hub peek embed (Abortion) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Such clinics offer an array of family planning services and served more than 182,000 people in 2020 in Texas, according to Every Body Texas, which administers the funds for the state. A bill filed by a Democrat in response to Kacsmaryk's ruling could face resistance from Republicans, who have controlled the Texas Legislature for two decades and padded their majority in the fall midterms.</p><p>For Republicans, new proposals include penalizing companies that help their Texas employees seek abortions elsewhere, limiting access to abortion-inducing drugs by mail and dispensing emergency contraception. Anti-abortion groups are also pushing lawmakers in the wake of Texas' abortion ban to spend more money on services for pregnant and parenting Texans, including expanding Medicaid coverage for mothers.</p><p>As Texas lawmakers returned to the Capitol, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and other GOP leaders did not mention further restrictions in ceremonial speeches on the opening day of session, where the Uvalde massacre and how to spend a more than $30 billion budget surplus are also poised to be major issues.</p><p>John Seago, president of the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life, said he doesn't see enough GOP support to create exceptions in the state’s abortion ban. “If we don’t respond to it this session, it kind of becomes the status quo,” Seago said.</p><p>After getting help from a Title X clinic, Sorsby-Jones said she spent years helping other teens find the resources to make independent reproductive health care decisions. In high school, she said, some of her peers had to hide their phones in bushes at a nearby fast food restaurant or leave them at school because of parental geolocation apps.</p><p>When she volunteered with a nonprofit that helps teens access reproductive health resources, Sorsby-Jones said clients included minors in abusive households and those who faced cultural barriers in seeking parental permission for birth control. Though the main focus was contraceptive care, Sorsby-Jones said for many teens, it had to do with accessing medication without stigma for conditions such as endometriosis, which caused them to miss school due to severe abdominal pain.</p><p>Rosann Mariappuram, executive director of Jane’s Due Process, said their organization’s hotline immediately began getting calls and texts with questions from Texas teens after the court decision in December. “When this ruling came down, it basically cut off reproductive rights for teenagers in Texas overnight really,” Mariappuram said.</p><p>At least 13 states have also banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with various exceptions, with many set to discuss ways to limit or expand access as legislatures go back into session across the country. Several existing bans, plus others that are less restrictive, are being challenged in court.</p><p>State Rep. Ana-Maria Ramos, a Democrat from Dallas, filed the proposal that would combat the Title X ruling. She was a recipient of Title X contraceptive care herself after having a child as a teenager.</p><p>“What this bill does is empower teens to make decisions for their own healthcare, but also for their future,” Ramos said.</p><p>_____</p><p>Follow AP's full coverage of abortion: <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/abortion">https://apnews.com/hub/abortion</a></p><p>_____</p><p>Follow Acacia Coronado on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/acacia_coronado">https://twitter.com/acacia_coronado</a></p><p>_____</p><p>This story has been corrected to show state Rep.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>BEIJING (AP) — Chinese embassies stopped issuing new visas for South Koreans and Japanese on Tuesday in apparent retaliation for COVID-19 measures recently imposed by those countries on travelers from China.</p><p>It wasn’t clear whether China would expand the visa suspensions to other countries that have imposed virus testing on passengers from China following its COVID-19 surge.</p><p>The embassies in Tokyo and Seoul announced the suspensions in brief online notices. </p><p>The Seoul notice, posted on the embassy's WeChat social media account, said the ban would continue until South Korea lifts its “discriminatory entry measures” against China. The announcement covered tourist, business and some other visas.</p><p>China's Foreign Ministry <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-sports-health-china-beijing-d9b5f0e1520c899ffe6b614135be73a8">threatened countermeasures</a> last week against countries that had announced new virus testing requirements for travelers from China. At least 10 in Europe, North America and Asia have done so recently, with officials expressing concern about a lack of information about the Chinese outbreak and the potential for new virus variants to emerge.</p><p>South Korea had also stopped issuing most short-term visas at its consulates in China for the month of January, except for government activities, essential business and humanitarian reasons. Japan has not announced a similar step. </p><p>China's embassy in Tokyo said only that visa issuance had been suspended. The announcements appeared to apply only to new applicants, with nothing about people currently holding visas.</p><p>Japan has protested the move through diplomatic channels, Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters in Argentina.</p><p>“It is extremely regrettable that China has restricted visa issuances," he said, adding that Japan would respond appropriately while watching China's outbreak and how much information the government shares about it.</p><p>A South Korean Foreign Ministry statement said that “our government’s step to strengthen anti-virus measures on passengers arriving from China is based on scientific and objective evidence ... and we have communicated with the Chinese side in advance.”</p><p>A Japanese Foreign Ministry official said earlier that it would be “regrettable” if restrictions were imposed. The official spoke on customary condition of anonymity.</p><p>A withholding of visas from South Korean or Japanese businesspeople could delay a hoped-for revival of commercial activity and potential new investment following China’s abrupt lifting of anti-virus controls last month.</p><p>Business groups had warned earlier that global companies were shifting investment plans away from China because it was too hard for foreign executives to visit under the pandemic controls. A handful of foreign auto and other executives have visited China over the past three years, but many companies have relied on Chinese employees or managers already in the country to run their operations.</p><p>A South Korean restaurant owner in Beijing said the announcement forced friends to postpone plans to visit China. He spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern his business might be affected. He added that he is preparing to renew his Chinese work visa and doesn’t know whether that will be affected.</p><p>In a phone call on Monday before the visa suspension was announced, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang “expressed concern” about the measures taken by South Korea to his counterpart, Foreign Minister Park Jin. Qin said he “hopes that the South Korean side will uphold an objective and scientific attitude."</p><p>China's move appeared to be grounded in its demands that its citizens be treated the same as those of other countries. About a dozen countries have followed the U.S. in requiring either a negative test before departing China, a virus test on arrival at the airport, or both.</p><p>“Regrettably, a handful of countries, in disregard of science and facts and the reality at home, have insisted on taking discriminatory entry restriction measures targeting China," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Tuesday. "China firmly rejected this and took reciprocal measures."</p><p>He did not respond directly when asked if new visas had been suspended for South Koreans and Japanese, saying only that he had “made it very clear."</p><p>The World Health Organization and several nations have accused China of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-covid19-data-sharing-77a28c2fc02f4c01774db8836762b608">withholding data</a> on its outbreak. A WHO official said Tuesday that t <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-covid-19-pandemic-china-europe-world-organization-2cead41e96c46b8027c26510bddb0873">he agency sees no immediate threat</a> for the European region from China's outbreak, but that more information is needed.</p><p>China’s ambassador to Australia said the response of those nations to China’s COVID-19 outbreak hadn’t been proportionate or constructive. </p><p>Xiao Qian told reporters in Canberra that China had shifted its strategy late last year from preventing infections to preventing severe cases.

(Texas Department of Criminal Justice via AP, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) — A former suburban Houston police officer was executed Tuesday for hiring two people to kill his estranged wife nearly 30 years ago amid a contentious divorce and custody battle. </p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/dd44af8e5d1149e3b8415bdaffd8b7b5">Robert Fratta</a>, 65, received a lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville for the November 1994 fatal shooting of his wife, Farah. He was pronounced dead at 7:49 p.m., 24 minutes after the lethal dose of the powerful sedative pentobarbital began flowing into his arms.</p><p>For about three minutes before the execution began, Fratta’s spiritual adviser, Barry Brown, prayed over Fratta, who was strapped to the death chamber gurney with intravenous needles in each arm.</p><p>Brown, his prayer book on the pillow next to Fratta's head and his right hand resting on Fratta's right hand, asked for prayers for “hearts that have been broken ... for people who grieved and those who will grieve in days ahead.” He asked God to “be merciful to Bobby.”</p><p>Asked by the warden if he had a final statement, Fratta replied: “No.”</p><p>Brown resumed praying as the lethal drugs began and Fratta, his eyes closed, took a deep breath and then snored loudly six times. Then all movement stopped.</p><p>Prosecutors say Fratta organized the murder-for-hire plot in which a middleman, Joseph Prystash, hired the shooter, Howard Guidry. Farah Fratta, 33, was shot twice in the head in her home’s garage in the Houston suburb of Atascocita. Robert Fratta, who was a public safety officer for Missouri City, had long claimed he was innocent.</p><div id="afs:Card:863611047472" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="95afdfe8a13c8ee253f466661e666f5c">Hub peek embed (U.S.SupremeCourt) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The punishment was delayed for little more than an hour until the last of a flurry of final-day appeals cleared the U.S. Supreme Court and Texas' highest courts, the Texas Supreme Court and Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. </p><p>Fratta’s lawyers argued unsuccessfully that prosecutors withheld evidence that a trial witness had been hypnotized by investigators, leading her to change her initial recollection that she saw two men at the murder scene as well as a getaway driver. </p><p>Prosecutors have argued the hypnosis produced no new information and no new identification. They had also said that Fratta had repeatedly expressed his desire to see his wife dead and asked several acquaintances if they knew anyone who would kill her, telling one friend, “I’ll just kill her, and I’ll do my time and when I get out, I’ll have my kids,” according to court records. Prystash and Guidry were also sent to death row for the slaying.</p><p>Fratta was also one of four Texas death row inmates who sued to stop the state’s prison system from using what they allege are expired and unsafe execution drugs. That lawsuit also failed late Tuesday,</p><p>The Supreme Court and lower courts previously rejected appeals from Fratta’s lawyers that sought to review claims arguing insufficient evidence and faulty jury instructions were used to convict him. His attorneys also unsuccessfully argued that a juror in his case was not impartial and that ballistics evidence didn’t tie him to the murder weapon. </p><p>The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles last week unanimously declined to commute Fratta’s death sentence to a lesser penalty or to grant a 60-day reprieve. </p><p>Fratta was first sentenced to death in 1996, but his conviction was overturned by a federal judge who ruled that confessions from his co-conspirators shouldn’t have been admitted into evidence. In the same ruling, the judge wrote that “trial evidence showed Fratta to be egotistical, misogynistic, and vile, with a callous desire to kill his wife.”</p><p>He was retried and resentenced to death in 2009.</p><p>Andy Kahan, the director of victim services and advocacy for Crime Stoppers of Houston, said that Farah Fratta’s father, Lex Baquer, who died in 2018, raised Robert and Farah Fratta’s three children with his wife. </p><p>Kahan, Fratta's son, Bradley Baquer, and Farah's brother, Zain Baquer, were among witnesses watching Fratta die. Fratta never acknowledged them or looked at them as they stood at a window to the death chamber.</p><p>“Bob was a coward in 1994, when he arranged the murder for hire of his estranged wife," Kahan said after the execution. “And 28-plus years later, he still was a coward tonight. When he was offered an opportunity to at least extend an olive branch to his son that he knew was watching this.</p><p>“And he still chose the coward's way out. He could have said: ‘I’m sorry.'”</p><p>Fratta was the first inmate put to death this year in Texas and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/crime-legal-proceedings-missouri-st-louis-capital-punishment-b45a31029fa42d9eb67b5b4e1f6a6ffe">the second in the U.S.</a> Eight other executions are scheduled in Texas for later this year. </p><p>___</p><p>Lozano reported from Houston.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Juan A.

Top awards went to Steven Spielberg’s “The Fabelmans” and Martin McDonagh’s “The Banshees of Inisherin.” (Jan. 11)</p>    <p>The Golden Globes returned to the air Tuesday with a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2023-golden-globes-fashion-best-looks-baa99ecc1d8da550694fa3f0bc0be8a5">red carpet flush with celebrities,</a> comedian Jerrod Carmichael as a hesitant emcee and top awards for Steven Spielberg's “The Fabelmans" and Martin McDonagh's “The Banshees of Inisherin,” <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-philadelphia-sitcoms-arts-and-entertainment-8085a9edf087ea8c6acd2cd6d0e6a568"></a> as the beleaguered award show sought to rekindle its pre-pandemic and pre-scandal glamour.</p><p>Spielberg’s autobiographical coming-of-age film “The Fabelmans” won best drama film and the dark friendship tale “The Banshees of Inisherin,” captured best film, comedy or musical. “Abbott Elementary,” “White Lotus” and “House of the Dragon” led the TV awards.</p><p>The Globes’ would-be comeback ended like many Globes ceremonies before it: with a triumphant Spielberg. For the fifth time, one of Spielberg's films won a best picture Globe. Nominated 14 times by the Globes for best director, Spielberg also won the honor for the third time. He began by thanking his three sisters, his late father and his late mother, Leah Adler ( <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-steven-spielberg-michelle-williams-kelly-reichardt-422c17059d14192ea2ce091e784d96d8">played by Michelle Williams</a> in the film). “She is up there kvelling about this right now,” said Spielberg.</p><p>Carmichael kicked off the <a href="https://apnews.com/GoldenGlobeAwards">80th Golden Globes</a> from the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, with little of the fanfare that usually opens such ceremonies. He plunged straight into the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/9ee1a25e378b0c707dcd1f5f205c405b">issues that drove the Globes off television</a> and led much of the entertainment industry to boycott the Hollywood Foreign Press Association after the group was revealed to have no Black members. Carmichael opened by asking the crowd to “be a little quiet here."</p><p>“I am your host, Jerrod Carmichael,” said the “Rothaniel” comedian. “And I'll tell you why I'm here. I'm here 'cause I'm Black.</p><p>“I won't say they were a racist organization,” he continued before sitting on the stage. “But they didn't have a single Black member until George Floyd died. So do with that information what you will.” </p><div id="c195b6f62c674f10baee75fcea100b6e" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>McDonagh's “The Banshees of Inisherin” left with three awards, including best screenplay for McDonagh and best actor in a comedy for Colin Farrrell. Fourteen years earlier, Farrell won a Globe for McDonagh's “In Bruges,” which <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-plays-martin-mcdonagh-colin-farrell-f5304b75bb64127e080e94e8736b8377">likewise paired him with Brendan Gleeson</a>. In his remarks, Farrell thanked the playwright, his castmates, his kids and the film’s donkey, Jenny.</p><p>On a soggy night following <a href="https://apnews.com/article/floods-weather-natural-disasters-landslides-and-mudslides-storms-21b103e791710f4af6ca0ce45c6030b5?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=TopNews&amp;utm_campaign=position_03">punishing, prolonged rains that have lashed Southern California</a>, the first award went to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ke-huy-quan-interview-everything-everywhere-spielberg-ab2601e87b405370853ce1ab12bf5dc2">Ke Huy Quan, the former child star</a> of “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom," for best supporting actor in “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” A clearly emotional Quan, who had left acting years before directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert cast him in their multiverse tale, thanked them for his second act.</p><p>"More than 30 years later, two guys thought of me," said Quan. “They remembered that kid. And they gave me the opportunity to try again.”</p><div id="1f7697d0-7820-11ed-f094-3bb60d58651d" class="related-story-embed"></div><p>Michelle Yeoh, the star of “Everything Everywhere At Once,” <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-movies-tyler-james-williams-angela-bassett-tv-a434cdd1941c10eb7fd056e4d59bd368">also won</a>, for best actress in a comedy or musical. The Malaysian-born Yeoh was just the second female actor of Asian descent to win in the category, after her “Crazy Rich Asian” costar Awkwafina, who won for “The Farewell” in 2020. “Forty years,” the 60-year-old Yeoh said. “Not letting go of this.”</p><div id="b6e06b58e32a4e8e8f5110d2030cfdd4" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Possibly Yeoh's stiffest competition at the Academy Awards, Cate Blanchett of “Tár,” won best actress on the drama side. Blanchett, in production, wasn't in attendance to pick up her fourth Globe. (Also absent was Kevin Costner, best-actor winner in a drama series for “Yellowstone.” Presenter Regina Hall said he was sheltering in place in Santa Barbara due to flooding.)</p><p>Angela Bassett, a likely Oscar frontrunner, won best supporting actress for her performance in “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever."</p><p>“Weeping may come in the evening, but joy comes in the morning,” Bassett said, referencing the loss of “Black Panther” star Chadwick Boseman.</p><p>Best actor was an upset. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/elvis-movie-review-b18e59c1b13c603e0fdd55adcea53f4d">Austin Butler won</a> for his performance in Baz Luhrmann's “Elvis." The favorite in the category has arguably been <a href="https://apnews.com/article/brendan-fraser-the-whale-darren-aronofsky-1b3e71f1022f11b26b764f238b421363">Brendan Fraser for “The Whale.”</a> Ahead of the Globes, Fraser said he would not attend because "my mother didn’t raise a hypocrite.” In 2018, Fraser said he was groped in 2003 by longtime HFPA member Philip Berk. Berk, who is no longer an HFPA member, denied it.</p><p>Mike White's “The White Lotus” won for best limited or anthology series. Fresh off her dramatic finale, Jennifer Coolidge gave one of the night’s lengthiest and warmest speeches while accepting the best supporting actress in a limited series award.</p><p>“Even if this is the end, you sort of changed my life in a million different ways,” Coolidge told White. “My neighbors are speaking to me, things like that.”</p><div id="20ce34df8c714787bec4f7e2c2e5a4f9" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>The public school sitcom “Abbott Elementary” came in the lead TV nominee and took home three awards, including best comedy series. Quinta Brunson, the show's creator and star, won best actress in a comedy series, and Tyler James Williams won for his supporting role.</p><p>“It has resonated with the world in a way that I couldn't even have imagined it would have," said Brunson as she thanked the studios that backed her vision. “But let's be real. I did imagine it. That's why I sold it to you.” </p><div id="1e38de70fda3427b95edafbc2e2ad53b" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Best drama series went to “Game of Thrones” prequel “House of the Dragon.” </p><p>“Naatu Naatu” from <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-india-4d04b6d032cabfc91b6d0beb6642c1ef">the Telugu sensation “RRR,</a> ” won best song over the likes of Rihanna and Taylor Swift. </p><p>The Globes were plunged into chaos shortly before <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nomadland-borat-winners-golden-globes-c1a33414af2358ff72f3ceda7f02125e">a largely remote pandemic 2021 awards show</a> when <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-02-21/hfpa-golden-globes-2021-who-are-the-members">a Los Angeles Times report</a> revealed that the HFPA, then numbering 87 members, had no Black members.</p><p>Stars and studios boycotted <a href="https://apnews.com/article/golden-globe-awards-entertainment-arts-and-entertainment-1ac9492d657cf39427c886bf65ed37b1">last year’s ceremony</a>, which NBC <a href="https://apnews.com/article/golden-globe-awards-7807652153518b2df70e636dd22654c2">opted not to televise</a>, saying the HFPA needed time to make “meaningful reform.”</p><p>Tom Cruise, whose “Top Gun: Maverick” was nominated for best picture, drama, famously returned his three Golden Globe awards after the HFPA revelations. Mid-show Tuesday, Carmichael came out with three trophies he said he found backstage, and suggested they be traded for Shelly Miscavige, the wife of the leader of the Church of Scientology. </p><p>The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-arts-and-entertainment-golden-globe-awards-65f15226ed39d816f5de20c0fa358d38">HFPA pledged to reform</a>, diversified its membership and changed some of the ways it operates. It now has 96 members, including six Black members, along with 103 nonmember voters. Billionaire Todd Boehly purchased the Globes and has begun turning the nonprofit group into a for-profit company.</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/golden-globe-nominations-2023-movies-television-hfpa-9d39f89d293e59ac5bda2d55cf21a9d6">Reaction to the Globe nominations last month was muted</a>. But much of the industry turned out Tuesday. Eddie Murphy and Ryan Murphy received tributes. Sean Penn introduced a message from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. </p><p>“There will be no third World War," Zelenskyy said in a taped message, predicting Russia's defeat. "It is not a trilogy.” </p><p>When the Globes were on the brink, NBC reworked its Globes deal into a one-year contract and moved the show from Sunday to Tuesday. That meant the Globes were essentially put on a one-year audition to recapture its awards-season perch.</p><p>As it has for most award shows, Globes viewership has cratered. After 18.4 million watched the 2020 awards, the 2021 edition managed just 6.9 million, according to Nielsen. Still, the Globes remain a valuable marketing tool for awards contenders, propping up ads for films in the long stretch between the holidays and the Oscars, which air March 12, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-oscars-show-9a69424884de11649b68a12a284353a1">a year after “the slap.”</a></p><p>Accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Award, Eddie Murphy said he knew the blueprint for longevity in show business: “Pay your taxes, mind your business, and keep Will Smith's wife's name out of your (expletive) mouth!”</p><div id="fff68322f4ad42a09a4b894879b20287" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>___</p><p>For more coverage of Hollywood's awards season, visit https://apnews.com/hub/awards-season</p>]]></description>

The warmth during their joint press conference stood in stark contrast to the more brusque exchange a day earlier.</p><p>Still, López Obrador prodded Biden to “insist” Congress regularize undocumented Mexican migrants who work in industries where American employers are struggling mightily to find enough workers.</p><div id="afs:Card:130243251955" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="d6f622d986bc07fae93fa4c53bfaaef9">Hub peek embed (JoeBiden) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The three-way gathering is held most years, although there was a hiatus while Trump was president. It’s often called the “three amigos summit,” a reference to the deep diplomatic and economic ties among the countries.</p><p>However, the leaders have found themselves at odds, especially as they struggle to handle <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-immigration-el-paso-d0a9ab87492fd4e9e3061ebefc6e1094">an influx of migrants</a> and to crack down on smugglers who profit from persuading people to make the dangerous trip to the United States.</p><p>In addition, Canada and the U.S. accuse López Obrador of violating a free trade pact by favoring Mexico’s state-owned utility over <a href="https://apnews.com/article/canada-mexico-caribbean-global-trade-7a53fb3f204bdc1e79f08a6ac852c20a">power plants built by foreign and private investors</a>. Meanwhile, Trudeau and López Obrador are concerned about Biden’s efforts to boost domestic manufacturing, creating concerns that U.S. neighbors could be left behind.</p><p>Trudeau emphasized in a one-on-one meeting with Biden the benefits of free trade and warned against Buy America policies that the U.S. administration has promoted, according to the prime minister's office. Nearly 80% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S., so avoiding protectionism remains a priority for Canada.</p><p>The key takeaways from the summit revolve around better connections among the three nations and a shared goal of a stronger North America on energy and in particular semiconductors, climate and a pledge to cut methane emissions, an agreement to manage large waves of migrants coming to the region and a more cohesive regional strategy on dealing with future pandemic-related health threats. </p><p>In their talks on Monday, López Obrador challenged Biden to improve life across the region, telling him that “you hold the key in your hand.”</p><p>“This is the moment for us to determine to do away with this abandonment, this disdain, and this forgetfulness for Latin America and the Caribbean,” Lopez Obrador said.</p><p>Biden responded by pointing to the billions of dollars that the United States spends in foreign aid around the world.</p><p>At the start of Tuesday's Biden-Trudeau meeting, the leaders spoke familiarly and with optimism. Trudeau called the U.S. president “Joe" and Biden joked with Trudeau — after the Canadian leader had delivered a statement to reporters in English and French — that he should have paid more attention in his college French classes.</p><p>Biden and Trudeau also discussed their countries' efforts to support Ukraine nearly 11 months after Russia's invasion. Canada announced Tuesday that it would buy an American-made National Advanced Surface to Air Missile System, or NASAMS, to be donated to Ukraine. The medium-range ground-based air defense system, which protects against drone, missile and aircraft attacks, costs about $406 million and brings Canada's contribution to Ukraine to more than $1 billion since the start of the war. </p><p>The White House said in a statement that the leaders also discussed “the generational opportunity to strengthen supply chains for critical minerals, electric vehicles, and semiconductors.” The U.S. administration also announced that Biden will make his first visit to Canada as president in March.</p><p>“There’s a lot of reasons to be optimistic, especially for those of us in our countries,” Trudeau said. “But it’s going to take a lot of work, something neither you or I or most our citizens have ever been afraid of.”</p><p>Biden and López Obrador haven’t been on particularly good terms for the past two years. The Mexican leader made no secret of his admiration for Trump, and last year <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-covid-politics-health-6efb4c2bde5d080a9ee400a0981f7a61">he skipped a Los Angeles summit</a> of the Americas because Biden didn’t invite the authoritarian leaders of Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. </p><p>But despite the tension, there's been cooperation. The U.S. and Mexico have also reached an agreement on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-mexico-immigration-af0643a4fb8f45388fe247e44c9b2c5e">a major shift in migration policy</a>, which Biden announced last week. </p><p>Under the plan, the U.S. will send 30,000 migrants per month from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela back across the border from among those who entered the U.S. illegally. Migrants who arrive from those four countries are not easily returned to their home countries for a variety of reasons.</p><p>In addition, 30,000 people per month from those four nations <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-venezuela-mexico-spokane-violence-0eb316a474baed22f433359b0644320b">who get sponsors,</a> background checks and an airline flight to the U.S. will be able to work legally in the country for two years. </p><p>The number of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border has risen dramatically during Biden’s first two years in office. There were more than 2.38 million stops during the year that ended Sept. 30, the first time the number topped 2 million. </p><p>López Obrador spoke at length about Mexico’s efforts to control the flow into the United States of fentanyl, the synthetic opioid that has become a scourge for many American communities. He noted that his government gave the military control of sea ports to help with the interdiction of precursor chemicals coming from Asia. </p><p>“We are battling fentanyl, these chemicals, and we are doing it because we care. No human is foreign to us,” he said. “It really matters to us to be able to help with what is happening in the United States, the deaths from fentanyl. But also as we discussed today, it is not only an issue for the United States, because if we don’t confront this problem, this scourge, we are going to suffer it, too. So we have to act in a coordinated way.”</p><p>Canada is being nudged by the U.S. and other allies to lead an international mission to Haiti to help solve the ongoing humanitarian and security crisis.</p><p>Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry and the country’s Council of Ministers sent an urgent appeal Oct. 7 calling for “the immediate deployment of a specialized armed force, in sufficient quantity” to stop the crisis caused partly by the “criminal actions of armed gangs.” But more than three months later, no countries have stepped forward.</p><p>Trudeau on Tuesday called the situation “heartbreaking." Both he and Biden said they will work with the United Nations Security Council to assist the Caribbean nation but also expressed caution about direct intervention.</p><p>“We need to make sure that the solutions are driven by the people of Haiti themselves,” Trudeau said.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Mark Stevenson and Maria Verza in Mexico City; Rob Gillies in Toronto; and Aamer Madhani, Chris Megerian and Josh Boak in Washington contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>
