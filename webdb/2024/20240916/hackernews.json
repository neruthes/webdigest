This library is two things: a very simple model and utilities that inference it (eg. fuzzy deduplication). The target platform is CPU, and it’s intended to be light, fast and pip installable — a library that lowers the barrier to working with strings \u003ci\u003esemantically\u003c/i\u003e. You don’t need to install pytorch to use it, or any deep learning runtimes.\u003cp\u003eHow can this be accomplished? The model is simply token embeddings that are average pooled. To create this model, I extracted token embedding (nn.Embedding) vectors from LLMs, concatenated them along the embedding dimension, added a learnable weight parameter, and projected them to a smaller dimension. Using the sentence transformers framework and datasets, I trained the pooled embedding with multiple negatives ranking loss and matryoshka representation learning so they can be truncated. After training, the weights and projections are no longer needed, because there is no contextual calculations. I inference the entire token vocabulary and save the new token embeddings to be loaded to numpy.\u003cp\u003eWhile the results are not impressive compared to transformer models, they perform well on MTEB benchmarks compared to word embedding models (which they are most similar to), while being much smaller in size (smallest model, 32k vocab, 64-dim is only 4MB).\u003cp\u003eOn the utility side, I’ve been adding some tools that I think it’ll be useful for. In addition to general embedding, there’s algorithms for ranking, filtering, clustering, deduplicating and similarity. Some of them have a cython implementation, and I’m continuing to work on benchmarking them and improving them as I have time. In addition to “standard” models that use cosine similarity for some algorithms, there are binarized models that use hamming distance. This is a slightly faster, similarity algorithm, with significantly less memory per embedding (float32 -\u003e 1 bit).\u003cp\u003eHope you enjoy it, and find it useful. PS I haven’t figured out Windows builds yet, but Linux and Mac are supported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41544969\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41544969\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 321\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 26\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://github.com/dleemiller/WordLlama","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41544969","date_published":"2024-09-15T03:25:14Z","author":{"name":"deepsquirrelnet","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=deepsquirrelnet"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41544386","title":"CSCI 181G PO: Game Engine Programming","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://cs.pomona.edu/classes/cs181g/\"\u003ehttps://cs.pomona.edu/classes/cs181g/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41544386\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41544386\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 110\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 20\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://cs.pomona.edu/classes/cs181g/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41544386","date_published":"2024-09-15T01:14:32Z","author":{"name":"memkit","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=memkit"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41544364","title":"Lazarus Group laundered $200M from 25 crypto hacks to fiat","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://zachxbt.mirror.xyz/B0-UJtxN41cJhpPtKv0v2LZ8u-0PwZ4ecMPEdX4l8vE\"\u003ehttps://zachxbt.mirror.xyz/B0-UJtxN41cJhpPtKv0v2LZ8u-0PwZ4ecMPEdX4l8vE\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41544364\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41544364\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 260\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 192\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://zachxbt.mirror.xyz/B0-UJtxN41cJhpPtKv0v2LZ8u-0PwZ4ecMPEdX4l8vE","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41544364","date_published":"2024-09-15T01:09:25Z","author":{"name":"noch","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=noch"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41544059","title":"Twelve sentenced for violent home invasion robberies to steal cryptocurrency","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/twelve-defendants-sentenced-violent-home-invasion-robberies-steal-cryptocurrency\"\u003ehttps://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/twelve-defendants-sentenced-violent-home-invasion-robberies-steal-cryptocurrency\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41544059\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41544059\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 129\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 89\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/twelve-defendants-sentenced-violent-home-invasion-robberies-steal-cryptocurrency","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41544059","date_published":"2024-09-15T00:03:21Z","author":{"name":"aa_is_op","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=aa_is_op"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41543805","title":"Why Scrum Is Stressing You Out","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://rethinkingsoftware.substack.com/p/why-scrum-is-stressing-you-out\"\u003ehttps://rethinkingsoftware.substack.com/p/why-scrum-is-stressing-you-out\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41543805\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41543805\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 202\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 192\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://rethinkingsoftware.substack.com/p/why-scrum-is-stressing-you-out","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41543805","date_published":"2024-09-14T23:11:25Z","author":{"name":"aard","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=aard"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41543666","title":"Ask HN: Former gifted children with hard lives, how did you turn out?","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eFor various life reasons, I developed depression, and I am autistic and have ADHD (diagnosed, treated).
