(AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) — With a scoop and score that will go down in franchise lore, Josh Allen may have put an end to the chaos and disappointment that has defined the Jacksonville Jaguars for the better part of the past decade.</p><p>Allen's <a href="https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1611934514577829890">37-yard fumble return with 2:51 remaining</a> helped the Jaguars beat rival Tennessee 20-16 on Saturday night and secure their first AFC South championship since 2017.</p><p>“I'm speechless,” Jaguars owner Shad Khan said before crediting coach Doug Pederson, general manager Trent Baalke and players. “I’ve always had confidence that we would be getting to where we needed to go.”</p><p>Khan easily could have singled out Allen and safety Rayshawn Jenkins, who forced Josh Dobbs’ fumble. Allen picked up the loose ball on a perfect bounce and ran, untouched, the other way for a lead that held up.</p><p>Dobbs fumbled again on the ensuing possession, and the Jaguars (9-8) started to celebrate their most significant regular-season victory in history.</p><p>“This was one of those games where our defense had to win it for us,” Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence said. "Us guys on offense, we’re a little frustrated because we left a lot out there. But in these games, just win. Our defense picked us up today. They played great.”</p><div id="afs:Card:234821764243" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="245237965ff4389a7d33ce3e58732333">Hub peek embed (NFL) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Jacksonville earned the No. 4 seed in the conference playoffs and will host either the Los Angeles Chargers or Baltimore in the wild-card round next weekend.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>It’s the 18th time in the last 20 seasons that at least one NFL team won its division after finishing last or tied for last the previous year.</p><p>Jacksonville closed the regular season with its fifth consecutive victory and became the fifth team in NFL history to make the playoffs with a five-game losing streak and a five-game winning streak in the same season.</p><p>“We just kept believing,” Lawrence said. “Nobody ever lost faith. Everybody believed in one another. We never started pointing the finger. We lost five games straight and we just got tighter.”</p><p>Tennessee (7-10) lost its final seven games, a skid that had just about everyone writing them off before Saturday’s finale.</p><p>“Nobody wants to finish how we did," Titans running back Derrick Henry said. "That’s never the plan, never the goal. Like I said, stuff happens, adversity happens.</p><p>"We wanted to win the division and have a great record, yeah, but it didn’t happen this year. All you can do is go back to work and be thankful for the journey and everybody in their efforts and look forward.”</p><p>The Titans rested several starters last week and essentially created a 10-day break to get healthy. They returned to their bruising brand of football and looked like they would pull an improbable turnaround — until Dobbs’ turnover changed the game.</p><p>“We just got on a (crappy) streak and couldn’t get off it," Titans coach Mike Vrabel said. "Couldn’t make the plays when we needed to. We couldn’t be consistent enough when we needed to and it showed up again.”</p><p>The Jaguars were 6 1/2-point favorites, according to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sportsbook.fanduel.com">FanDuel Sportsbook</a>, and a near-sellout crowd was on hand to witness what many thought would be more of a coronation than a scratch-and-claw nail-biter.</p><p>The Titans didn’t do anything spectacular. With quarterback Ryan Tannehill (ankle) out for the season, they leaned on Dobbs — an aerospace engineer who has bounced around the league — to be smart with the ball and Henry to grind out tough yards. And they relied on a defense that’s been stout against the run all year.</p><p>It worked for 57 minutes — and then it unraveled.</p><p>Henry finished with 109 yards on 30 carries. Dobbs completed 20 of 29 passes for 179 yards, with a touchdown, an interception and the fumble. </p><p>Lawrence completed 20 of 32 passes for 212 yards, with a touchdown and a fumble. Lawrence had two would-be touchdowns in the second half fall incomplete. He overthrew Zay Jones in the end zone and underthrew Christian Kirk.</p><p>Nearly all of the 70,000-plus on hand were waiting for Lawrence to do something down the stretch. Instead, the Jags became the first team since Carolina in 2000 to pull off a fourth-quarter comeback without gaining a first down in the quarter, according to ESPN Stats &amp; Info.</p><p>STIFF ARM</p><p>Henry <a href="https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1611905881809227776">added another impressive stiff-arm to his highlight reel</a> filled with them. He tossed Jenkins to the ground in the second quarter to cap a 14-yard gain, setting off a flurry of social media posts about the move.</p><p>Henry, who grew up outside Jacksonville in Yulee, finished the first half with 71 yards on the ground, but added just 38 after intermission.</p><p>MEMORABLE MOMENT</p><p>Both teams gathered at midfield together before the game to pray, some of them still wearing shirts to honor Buffalo's Demar Hamlin. Tennessee linebacker Rashad Weaver, college teammates with Hamlin at Pitt, wore Hamlin's No. 3 on his eye black.</p><p>Weaver later recovered Lawrence's fumble on a <a href="https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1611904199033516032">misguided trick play</a> in the first half.</p><p>___</p><p>AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://apnews.com/hub/pro-32 and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL</p>]]></description>

The 91-page complaint says the social media companies have created a public nuisance by targeting their products to children. </p><p>It blames them for worsening mental health and behavioral disorders including anxiety, depression, disordered eating and cyberbullying; making it more difficult to educate students; and forcing schools to take steps such as hiring additional mental health professionals, developing lesson plans about the effects of social media, and providing additional training to teachers. </p><p>“Defendants have successfully exploited the vulnerable brains of youth, hooking tens of millions of students across the country into positive feedback loops of excessive use and abuse of Defendants’ social media platforms,” the complaint said. “Worse, the content Defendants curate and direct to youth is too often harmful and exploitive ....”</p><p>Meta, Google, Snap and TikTok did not immediately respond to requests for comment Saturday.</p><div id="afs:Card:606287419119" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="965a8f373e3bfed8157571912cc3b542">Hub peek embed (Socialmedia) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>While federal law — Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act — helps protect online companies from liability arising from what third-party users post on their platforms, the lawsuit argues that provision does not protect the tech giants' behavior in this case.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“Plaintiff is not alleging Defendants are liable for what third-parties have said on Defendants’ platforms but, rather, for Defendants’ own conduct,” the lawsuit said. “Defendants affirmatively recommend and promote harmful content to youth, such as pro-anorexia and eating disorder content."</p><p>The lawsuit says that from 2009 to 2019, there was on average a 30% increase in the number of Seattle Public Schools students who reported feeling “so sad or hopeless almost every day for two weeks or more in a row" that they stopped doing some typical activities.</p><p>The school district is asking the court to order the companies to stop creating the public nuisance, to award damages, and to pay for prevention education and treatment for excessive and problematic use of social media.</p><p>While hundreds of families are pursuing lawsuits against the companies over harms they allege their children have suffered from social media, it's not clear if any other school districts have filed a complaint like Seattle's. </p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/hub/the-facebook-papers">Internal studies revealed by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen in 2021</a> showed that the company knew that Instagram negatively affected teenagers by harming their body image and making eating disorders and thoughts of suicide worse.

(AP Photo/Bertha Wang)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>BEIJING (AP) — After two years of separation from his wife in mainland China, Hong Kong resident Cheung Seng-bun made sure to be among the first in line following the reopening of border crossing points Sunday.</p><p>The ability of residents of the semi-autonomous southern Chinese city to cross over is one of the most visible signs of China’s easing of border restrictions, with travelers arriving from abroad also no longer required to undergo quarantine.</p><p>“I’m hurrying to get back to her,” Cheung, lugging a heavy suitcase, told The Associated Press as he prepared to cross at Lok Ma Chau station.</p><p>Travelers crossing between Hong Kong and mainland China, however, are still required to show a negative COVID-19 test taken within the last 48 hours — a measure China has protested when imposed by other countries.</p><p>Hong Kong has been hard-hit by the virus, and its land and sea border checkpoints with the mainland have been largely closed for almost three years. Despite the risk of new infections, the reopening that will allow tens of thousands of people who have made prior online bookings to cross each day is expected to provide a much-needed boost to Hong Kong’s tourism and retail sectors. </p><p>On a visit to the station Sunday morning, Hong Kong's Chief Executive John Lee said the sides would continue to expand the number of crossing points from the current seven to the full 14.</p><div id="afs:Card:029281580227" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="49e31dedb78fd24c1077b340ebdafa1f">Hub peek embed (apf-Health) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“The goal is to get back as quickly as possible to the pre-epidemic normal life," Lee told reporters. “We want to get cooperation between the two sides back on track."</p><p>Communist Party newspaper Global Times quoted Tan Luming, a port official in Shenzhen on the border with Hong Kong, saying about 200 passengers were expected to take the ferry to Hong Kong, while another 700 were due to travel in the other direction, on the first day of reopening. Tan said a steady increase in passenger numbers is expected over coming days. </p><p>“I stayed up all night and got up at 4:00 a.m. as I’m so excited to return to the mainland to see my 80-year-old mother," a Hong Kong woman identified only by her surname, Cheung, said on arrival at Shenzhen, where she was presented with “roses and health kits," the paper said. </p><p>Hong Kong media reports said around 300,000 travel bookings from the city to mainland China have already been made. </p><p>Limited ferry service had also been restored from China's Fujian province to the Taiwanese-controlled island of Kinmen just off the Chinese coast.</p><p>The border crossing with Russia at Suifenhe in the far northern province of Heilongjiang also resumed normal operations, just in time for the opening of the ice festival in the capital of Harbin, a major tourism draw.</p><p>China's borders remain largely sealed, however, with only a fraction of the previous number of international flights arriving at major airports. </p><p>Beijing's main Capital International Airport was expecting eight flights from overseas on Sunday, according to the airport. Shanghai, China's largest city, received its first international flight under the new policy at 6:30 a.m. with only a trickle of other international flights to follow.</p><p>That number is expected now to tick upward, with booking inquiries for overseas flights overwhelming some online travel services ahead of the Lunar New Year travel rush later this month. Capital International is preparing to reopen arrival halls that have been quiet for most of the past three years. </p><p>Shanghai, meanwhile, announced it would again start issuing regular passports to Chinese for foreign travel and family visits, as well as renewing and extending visas for foreigners. Those restrictions have had a particularly devastating effect on foreign businesspeople and students in the key Asian financial center. </p><p>China is now <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-health-china-government-beijing-762d314d452875ecc525d5c21dbfa541">facing a surge in cases and hospitalizations</a> in major cities and is bracing for a further spread into less developed areas with the start of China's most important holiday of the year, set to get underway in coming days. </p><p>Authorities say they expect domestic rail and air journeys will double over the same period last year, bringing overall numbers close to those of the 2019 holiday period before the pandemic hit.</p><p>Meanwhile, the controversy continues over testing requirements being imposed on Chinese travelers by foreign governments — most recently Germany and Sweden. On Saturday, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock urged citizens to avoid “unnecessary” travel to China, noting the rise in coronavirus cases in the country and saying that China’s Health system is “overburdened.”</p><p>The German regulation also allows for spot checks on arrival and Germany, like other European nations, will test wastewater from aircrafts for possible new virus variants. The measures come into force at midnight Monday and are due to last until April 7.</p><p>Apparently concerned about its reputation, China says the testing requirements aren’t science-based and has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-health-china-government-beijing-762d314d452875ecc525d5c21dbfa541">threatened unspecified countermeasures.</a></p><p>Chinese health authorities publish a daily count of new cases, severe cases and deaths, but those numbers include only officially confirmed cases and use a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-china-covid-d130817ed350e805295ee16c50ae6a46">very narrow definition of COVID-19-related deaths.</a></p><p>Authorities say that since the government ended compulsory testing and permitted people with mild symptoms to test themselves and convalesce at home, it can no longer provide a full picture of the state of the latest outbreak. </p><p>Government spokespeople have said the situation is under control and reject accusations from the World Health Organization and others that it is not being transparent about the number of cases and deaths or providing other crucial information on the nature of the current outbreak that could lead to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/science-health-china-covid-306b688d84e31a9462f82d0ead1f4584">the emergence of new variants. </a></p><p>Despite such assertions, the Health Commission on Saturday rolled out regulations for strengthened monitoring of viral mutations, including testing of urban wastewater. The lengthy rules called for increased data gathering from hospitals and local government health departments and stepped-up checks on “pneumonia of unknown causes.” </p><p>Criticism has largely focused on heavy-handed enforcement of regulations, including open-ended travel restrictions that saw people confined to their homes for weeks, sometimes sealed inside without adequate food or medical care. </p><p>Anger was also vented over the requirement that anyone who potentially tested positive or had been in contact with such a person be confined for observation in a field hospital, where overcrowding, poor food and hygiene were commonly cited.</p><p>The social and economic costs eventually prompted rare street protests in Beijing and other cities, possibly influencing the Communist Party’s decision to swiftly ease the strictest measures and reprioritize growth. </p><p>As part of the latest changes, China will also no longer bring criminal charges against people accused of violating border quarantine regulations, according to a notice issued by five government departments on Saturday. </p><p>Individuals currently in custody will be released and seized assets returned, the notice said. </p><p>The Transportation Ministry on Friday called on travelers to reduce trips and gatherings, particularly if they involve elderly people, pregnant women, small children and those with underlying conditions.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press reporters Alice Fung and Karmen Li in Hong Kong and Frank Jordans in Berlin contributed to this report. </p>]]></description>

They want to have fun doing it.</p><p>Late in the first half Saturday against the Las Vegas Raiders, the Chiefs huddled and spun in a circle, broke out into the shotgun with running back Jerick McKinnon taking a direct snap. He faked a handoff to Kadarius Toney and pitched to quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who then threw to Toney for a 9-yard touchdown.</p><p>But, it didn't count. A holding penalty brought back the play. The Chiefs then scored anyway to take full control of what became a 31-13 victory.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/espn/status/1611855455332012032?s=20&amp;t=YrAkuL5WZGve3GZtT849Kg">The play</a> is called the Snow Globe or Arctic Circle, depending on who is asked. But, even if it didn't count, it underscored the Chiefs' creativity and willingness to have fun, even while playing for playoff positioning and a week off.</p><p>“We talked about it on the side, ‘Let’s see if we can get some confusion going and throw something back.'" Mahomes said. "It worked. We just had the holding penalty. We got some good things going for the playoffs, and whatever we run has to work.”</p><p>That, Chiefs coach Andy Reid said, was the bottom line.</p><p>“You do (want to make it fun), but you want to score, too," Reid said. “It's not fun when you're not doing that.”</p><div id="afs:Card:234821764243" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="5d08f366a1e2319104eb54ce22a570d2">Hub peek embed (NFL) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Almost lost was the NFL record for total yards in a season that Mahomes set. He passed for 202 yards and rushed for 29 against the Raiders, giving him 5,608 total yards this season. That surpassed the record of 5,562 yards set by Drew Brees in 2011 with the New Orleans Saints.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“Pat was on fire,” Reid said. “He's throwing these (statistics) out there like they're nothing.”</p><p>More than setting the mark, Mahomes helped ensure the top seed for the Chiefs (14-3) and a bye in the first round of the playoffs, which begin next weekend. Kansas City, however, is not assured of home-field advantage throughout the postseason.</p><p>Because Monday night’s Buffalo-Cincinnati game was canceled, the Chiefs could wind up playing the Bills or Bengals in the AFC championship on a neutral field. The Buffalo-Cincinnati game initially was postponed after Bills safety Damar <a href="https://apnews.com/article/damar-hamlin-collapse-buffalo-bills-cincinnati-bengals-c9f684bdaccd1e3f77bda6c77baca75e">Hamlin went into cardiac arrest</a>. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/buffalo-bills-nfl-sports-health-damar-hamlin-28a376ee8c719bf344eac27ab689046c">Hamlin remains in critical condition, but is improving.</a></p><p>This was the first NFL game played since Hamlin was hospitalized. Both teams wore black shirts in warmups that read “LOVE FOR DAMAR” with his No. 3 in the middle. Mahomes also wore a hoodie that had a drawing of the player with “HAMLIN STRONG” below it. </p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/buffalo-bills-chicago-bears-detroit-lions-cincinnati-bengals-sports-48092707c1e931283a149919882e41e9">Instead of a moment of silence before the game</a>, the Allegiant Stadium public-address announcer asked fans to cheer on Hamlin's recovery.</p><p>“It was definitely weird,” Mahomes said of returning to the field. “It's a game that you love, you play your entire life. It's brought so many great things to you. But, obviously, with the situation that happened Monday night with Damar, you still have that in the back of your mind. You want to be there for him, and there is so much stuff bigger than football.”</p><p>The Chiefs matched their franchise record for regular-season victories, set in 2020, and they set a team mark with their 17th consecutive game of at least 300 yards of offense.</p><p>The Raiders (6-11) ended their first season under coach Josh McDaniels with three consecutive losses and four defeats in five games. They made the playoffs a year ago, but now face serious questions at quarterback, offensive line and throughout the defense.</p><p>Jarrett Stidham started his second game in a row in place of the sidelined Derek Carr, and this performance didn’t go nearly as well as the first one. Stidham completed 22 of 36 passes for 219 yards with a touchdown and interception. He was sacked six times.</p><p>A week ago, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/The%20Chiefs%20matched%20their%20franchise%20record%20for%20regular-season%20victories%20set%20in%202020,%20and%20they%20set%20a%20team%20mark%20with%20their%2017th%20consecutive%20game%20of%20at%20least%20300%20yards.%20Patrick%20Mahomes%20(stats).%20The%20Raiders%20(6-11)%20ended%20their%20first%20season%20under%20coach%20Josh%20McDaniels%20with%20three%20consecutive%20losses%20and%20four%20defeats%20in%20five%20games.%20They%20made%20the%20playoffs%20a%20year%20ago,%20but%20now%20face%20serious%20questions%20at%20quarterback,%20offensive%20line%20and%20throughout%20the%20defense.%20Jarrett%20Stidham%20started%20his%20second%20game%20in%20a%20row%20in%20place%20of%20the%20sidelined%20Derek%20Carr,%20and%20this%20performance%20didn%E2%80%99t%20go%20nearly%20as%20well%20as%20the%20first%20one.%20Stidham%20(stats),%20and%20he%20was%20sacked%20()%20times.%20A%20week%20ago,%20he%20threw%20for%20365%20yards%20and%20three%20touchdowns%20in%20a%2037-34%20overtime%20loss%20to%20the%20San%20Francisco%2049ers.">he threw for 365 yards and three touchdowns</a> in a 37-34 overtime loss to the San Francisco 49ers.</p><p>Stidham said he hasn't thought much about trying to retain the starting job next season with the Raiders.</p><p>“Do I feel like I'm that caliber player in this league?” he said. “Absolutely. I just tried to be ready for my opportunity these last two weeks and try to take full advantage of it."</p><p>Raiders running back Josh Jacobs, who was dealing with hip and oblique injuries as well as a reported family emergency, was a game-day decision but played. He rushed for 45 yards and could possibly win the NFL rushing title with 1,653 yards.</p><p>But Jacobs fell short of the franchise rushing record of 1,759 yards set by Marcus Allen in 1985. This was potentially Jacobs’ final game as a member of the Raiders because his fifth-year option was not picked up. His performance this season has given Las Vegas officials plenty to consider.</p><p>NOTES</p><p>Chiefs linebacker Nick Bolton made 16 tackles, giving him 180 for the season and breaking the team record of 179 set by Derrick Johnson in 2011. … Kansas City running back Jerick McKinnon has caught a touchdown pass in six consecutive games. He has nine TDs total over that span. … Chiefs rookie defensive end George Karlaftis has 5½ sacks in seven games. … Kansas City tight end Travis Kelce caught six passes for 38 yards, giving him 110 receptions this season, just one off the Chiefs’ mark set by Tyreek Hill last season.</p><p>INJURIES</p><p>Chiefs: DE Frank Clark (groin) went out in the second quarter.</p><p>Raiders: CB Nate Hobbs (hand) and LB Harvey Langi (concussion) went out and didn’t return.</p><p>UP NEXT</p><p>Chiefs: Regular season is over.

(Jan. 5)</p>    <p>EL PASO, Texas (AP) — Several hundred people marched through the streets of El Paso Saturday afternoon, and when they arrived at a group of <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/immigration">migrants</a> huddling outside a church, they sang to them “no estan solos” — “you are not alone.”</p><p>Around 300 migrants have taken refuge on sidewalks outside Sacred Heart Church, some of them afraid to seek more formal shelters, advocates say, amid new restrictions meant to crack down on illegal border crossings.</p><p>This is the scene that will greet President Joe Biden on his first, politically thorny visit to the southern border Sunday. </p><p>The president announced last week that Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians and Venezuelans will be expelled to Mexico if they enter the U.S. illegally — an expansion of a pandemic-era immigration policy called Title 42. The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-mexico-immigration-af0643a4fb8f45388fe247e44c9b2c5e">new rules</a> will also include offering humanitarian parole for up to 30,000 people a month from those four countries if they apply online and find a financial sponsor.</p><p>Biden is scheduled to arrive in El Paso Sunday afternoon before traveling on to Mexico City to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-mexico-government-us-national-security-council-united-states-599d640834d079503c5dd568c312c19f">meet with North American leaders</a> on Monday and Tuesday.</p><p>Dylan Corbett, who runs the nonprofit Hope Border Institute, said the city is experiencing an increasing “climate of fear.” </p><div id="afs:Card:130243251955" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="82701453fb018778c04255c1e2b10564">Hub peek embed (JoeBiden) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>He said immigration enforcement agencies have already started ratcheting up deportations to Mexico, and he senses a rising level of tension and confusion.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The president’s new policy expands on an existing effort to stop Venezuelans attempting to enter the U.S., which began in October.</p><p>Corbett said many Venezuelans have since been left in limbo, putting a strain on local resources. He said expanding those policies to other migrants will only worsen the circumstances for them on the ground. </p><p>“It’s a very difficult situation because they can’t go forward and they can’t go back,” he said. People who aren’t processed can’t leave El Paso because of U.S. law enforcement checkpoints; most have traveled thousands of miles from their homelands and refuse to give up and turn around. </p><p>“There will be people in need of protection who will be left behind,” Corbett said. </p><p>The new restrictions represent a major change to immigration rules that will stand even if the U.S. Supreme Court ends a Trump-era public health law that allows U.S. authorities to turn away asylum-seekers.</p><div id="17b30ddf617e4f08a5bbe3f0e58d9460" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>El Paso has swiftly become the busiest of the Border Patrol’s nine sectors along the U.S. border with Mexico, occupying the top slots in October and November. Large numbers of Venezuelans began showing up in September, drawn to the relative ease of crossing, robust shelter networks and bus service on both sides of the border, and a major airport to destinations across the United States.</p><p>Venezuelans ceased to be a major presence almost overnight after Mexico, under Title 42 authority, agreed on Oct. 12 to accept those who crossed the border illegally into the United States. Nicaraguans have since filled that void. Title 42 restrictions have been applied 2.5 million times to deny migrants a right to seek asylum under U.S. and international law on grounds of preventing the spread of COVID-19.</p><p>U.S. authorities stopped migrants 53,247 times in November in the El Paso sector, which stretches across 264 miles of desert in West Texas and New Mexico but sees much of its activity in the city of El Paso and suburban Sunland Park, New Mexico. The most recent monthly tally for the sector was more than triple the same period of 2021, with Nicaraguans the top nationality by far, followed by Mexicans, Ecuadoreans, Guatemalans and Cubans. </p><p>Many gathered under blankets outside Sacred Heart Church. The church opens its doors at night to families and women, so not all of the hundreds caught in this limbo must sleep outside in the dropping temperatures. Two buses were available for people to warm up and charge their phones. Volunteers come with food and other supplies. </p><p>Juan Tovar held a Bible in his hands, his 7-year-old daughter hoisted onto his shoulders. The 32-year-old was a bus driver in Venezuela before he fled with his wife and two daughters because of the political and financial chaos that has consumed their home country. </p><p>He has friends in San Antonio prepared to take them in, he said. He’s here to work and provide an education for his daughters, but he’s stuck in El Paso without a permit. </p><p>“Everything is in the hands of God,” he said. “We are all humans and we want to stay.” </p><p>Another Venezuelan, 22-year-old Jeremy Mejia, overheard and said he had a message he’d like to send to the president. </p><p>“President Biden, I ask God to touch your heart so we can stay in this country,” Mejia said. “I ask you to please touch your heart and help us migrants have a better future in the U.S.” </p><p>___ </p><p>Leighton reported from El Paso and Spagat from Yuma, Arizona. AP writer Claire Galofaro contributed to this report from Louisville, Kentucky. </p>]]></description>

He was forced to roll through 14 ballots before he finally won a majority vote on the 15th vote, but not before the final chaotic scene of shouting between allies and holdouts pushed balloting into early Saturday.</p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="e986c620149b72030bb418bd5fadb4a2">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>In the end, McCarthy emerges as a weakened speaker, one with less authority on paper than those before him. That's particularly true because he agreed to give the hard-right holdouts a key concession: restoring a rule that allows any single lawmaker to make a “motion to vacate the chair,” essentially a vote to oust the speaker from that leadership post.</p><p>But in some ways, the son of gritty Bakersfield, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-bakersfield-california-kevin-mccarthy-congress-5e355091d9f308b1b93a9faaec610d5a">an oil-and-agricultural heartland in central California</a>, also becomes emboldened as a survivor who withstood one of history’s most brutal brawls for power and who prides himself on being an underestimated political fighter.</p><div id="069855bfd0ff4d27a8b6cec77a189ddf" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>“Apparently, I like to make history,” McCarthy quipped at one point during the raucous week.</p><p>McCarthy staked his political career on early backing of Trump, and it was the former president who delivered when needed, making late phone calls to holdouts and “helping get those final votes.” When it was finally over, when McCarthy walked into the speaker's office at the Capitol, the sign bearing his name already was hanging.</p><p>Plenty of tests await.</p><p>Congress faces an agenda of must-pass bills to fund the government, restock a military whose supplies have been depleted by decades of war and aid to Ukraine, authorize farming programs and raise the nation's borrowing limit to avert an unprecedented federal default.</p><p>For the first time as president, Biden will face a divided government, with the House in Republican hands and the Senate still controlled, though narrowly, by Democrats.</p><p>Divided government can be a time of bipartisan deal-making as the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-ketanji-brown-jackson-politics-europe-donald-trump-143cce189228d6563eba07298cc9f8a1">parties come together to accomplish big priorities</a>. But more often it results in brinkmanship that has led to stalemates, standoffs and shutdowns.</p><p>House Republicans are eager to confront Biden with oversight of the White House's handling of the U.S.-Mexico border, the COVID-19 crisis and other issues, along with investigations of Biden, his family and his administration.</p><p>“I came to Washington to challenge the status quo," wrote Republican Bob Good of Virginia in an op-ed before his many votes against McCarthy. “I intend to keep that promise.” Good was one of six Republican who voted “present” in the <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202320">final roll call.</a></p><p>McCarthy has been here before.</p><p>In 2011, tea party Republicans took control of the House, confronting the agenda of President Barack Obama and his vice president, Biden. The movement opposed the Washington political establishment and espoused a conservative and libertarian philosophy, advocating for less spending, lower taxes and reducing the national debt and budget deficit.</p><p>McCarthy helped recruit the tea party class, and he went on to become the third-ranking Republican, part of the “Young Guns” with Ryan of Wisconsin and then-Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia. </p><p>Fueled by the tea party, they went on to lead House Republicans into crisis after crisis with efforts to cut federal spending during the “fiscal cliff” of 2012 and federal shutdowns in 2013 as they tried to repeal Obama's health care program. </p><p>In 2015, when then-Rep. Mark Meadows, the North Carolina Republican who led the Freedom Caucus and later served as Trump's last chief of staff, threatened a “motion to vacate the chair" — a vote to oust the speaker — Boehner chose early retirement. </p><p>McCarthy tried to take Boehner's place, but he dropped out of the race when it was clear he would not have support from conservatives. Ryan ended up with the job. But he, too, retired in the Trump era.</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/hub/nancy-pelosi">Speaker Nancy Pelosi</a>, D-Calif., did away with the “vacate the chair” rule when Democrats regained the majority in 2019. A seasoned legislator who had made history as the first woman to be speaker, Pelosi ran the House with the strength of experience.</p><p>McCarthy has been in office for 15 years, half as long as Pelosi when she first took the helm, and with far fewer legislative victories to speak of. In talks over the past week with the hard-liners, he was forced to reinstate the “motion to vacate the chair” to win over the holdouts. They can now hold it over him every single day.</p><p>“If a CEO is not doing the job, you can fire him — same thing in politics,” said Republican Ralph Norman of South Carolina, one of the holdouts McCarthy won over with the rules changes.</p><p>The chaos that erupted on the House floor this past week may end up as a prelude to the Congress to come.</p><p>“What you saw over the last week,” Norman said, "is how democracy works."</p>]]></description>

(Jan. 6)</p>    <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Without a TV show, starry red carpet, host, press or even a livestream, the <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/golden-globe-awards">Golden Globe Awards</a> were in chaos last year after scandal broke over lack of diversity, accusations of sexism, and ethical and financial lapses among members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.</p><p>Once known as Hollywood’s biggest, booziest party that regularly drew 18 million television viewers, the doling out of statues was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/golden-globe-awards-7807652153518b2df70e636dd22654c2">reduced to a 90-minute private event</a> with no celebrities present at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.</p><p>Winners were announced on Twitter, often without specifying what project a person had actually won for.</p><p>What a difference a year can make.</p><p>After dumping the telecast in the aftermath of a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-02-21/hfpa-golden-globes-2021">damaging expose by the Los Angeles Times</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/golden-globes-return-2023-nbc-fd8fefb130eafdad03807a944f25ea1d">NBC will put the battered 80-year-old Globes</a> back on the air Tuesday under a one-year deal, as opposed to multi-year contracts of the past worth tens of millions of dollars. </p><p>A wave of celebrities plan to attend, along with star presenters and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jerrod-carmichael-golden-globes-host-2023-d60e244c609ad4cf23a6789fdeab6a68">funnyman host Jerrod Carmichael</a> after the embattled controllers of the Globes dug deep into the work of implementing top-down reforms.</p><div id="8e30a7417f284b588fdf017ae3de99ff" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>There’s now a strict code of conduct, refreshed bylaws, a ban on gifts and new rules on accepting travel and other perks from the industry. Contentious news conferences were dumped, and the pool of awards voters was expanded beyond the 87 Los Angeles-based foreign journalists who once ruled the organization.</p><div id="afs:Card:038204960080" content-id="9ee1a25e378b0c707dcd1f5f205c405b" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (apf-TV) - Compressed layout (automatic embed)</div><p>But are the powerful publicists, studios and other stakeholders who boycotted in protest satisfied with the changes? And are those changes the beginning — or closer to the end?</p><p>“It's, by far, not over,” said German journalist Helen Hoehne, who took over as president of the HFPA a year and a half ago. “We always said when we started this journey that it would be ongoing and that it would take some time.”</p><p>Kelly Bush Novak, CEO and founder of the A-list public relations firm ID, said more must be done, but she supports steps taken so far.</p><p>“We came together ... to ensure the future of the Globes, in step with our culture and our shared values as an industry, and we see commendable and seismic progress,” she said. "I’m optimistic that the work will continue.” </p><div id="67353cf0c24b4002a97ccd1c5780352f" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Still, Novak acknowledged not all stakeholders are on board ahead of Tuesday's broadcast, despite sweeping changes aimed at restoring the luster of the Globes.</p><p>Last year, publicists like Novak banded together to battle the HFPA, and studios that included Netflix and WarnerMedia cut ties with the organization after the LA Times raised questions about corruption and a range of bias issues over race and sexual orientation.</p><p>None of the 87 Hollywood Foreign Press Association <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-02-21/hfpa-golden-globes-2021-who-are-the-members#:~:text=2021%20Golden%20Globes%20group%20has%20no%20Black%20members%20%2D%20Los%20Angeles%20Times">members was Black</a> and the group had not had a Black member since at least 2002.</p><p>Now, after an effort to increase and diversify its ranks, 199 people decide who gets a Globe, a mix of 96 HFPA members and outsiders from other countries brought in to dilute the power of the old guard. Membership eligibility was expanded from Los Angeles to anywhere in the United States. </p><p>Heading into the telecast, Globes voters stand at 52% female, and 51.8% racially and ethnically diverse, including 19.6% Latino, 12.1% Asian, 10.1% Black and 10.1% Middle Eastern. Voters also include those who are LGBTQIA+. In all, 62 countries are represented.</p><p>The governing board was expanded from nine to 15 and includes three Black members, two of whom vote on rules and other matters but not awards. Overall, the organization now has six Black HFPA members and 14 Black international Globes voters who aren't members.</p><div id="ece237cd65424ddf9cd9b56219e1c5ce" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Perhaps the most significant change: The Globes were purchased by billionaire Todd Boehly, who also owns the Beverly Hilton, Globes producer dick clark productions and the Chelsea soccer team. He's shifting the voting body from its founding nonprofit status to a for-profit model, pending approval by the California attorney general. He plans to preserve the HFPA's charitable work with a separate nonprofit entity.</p><p>A hotline managed by two independent law firms was opened, with complaints investigated by outsiders. A chief diversity officer was hired, and mandatory racial, sexual harassment and sexual orientation sensitivity training was put in place, required for any HFPA member casting Globe votes.</p><p>Michelle Williams, nominated for her turn in “The Fabelmans,” is among dozens of stars panning to attend Tuesday.</p><p>“It feels to me like the community as a whole has decided that this organization has really done a lot of work to reform themselves and that we can support change, like we can hold people accountable and then we can support them as they continue to journey in their path towards being a better organization,” she said.</p><p>Added Judd Hirsch, nominated for the same film: “We'll be there. We'll give them another chance.”</p><p>Dumping news conferences at the center of insensitive questions posed to talent who felt obligated to show up helped cool off some critics, but not all.</p><p>“I can’t speak for everyone. There may be some reluctance to participate," Novak said. “We must acknowledge the past and will never forget the damage done. Manifesting a new future requires it.”</p><p>Brendan Fraser, nominated for his performance in “The Whale,” <a href="https://apnews.com/article/brendan-fraser-will-not-attend-2023-golden-globes-d09df6c03e4094acf835ec65d2e8bbaa">will not be there Tuesday</a>. In 2018, Fraser said he was groped by Philip Berk, a former HFPA president who is from South Africa. </p><p>Berk <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-race-and-ethnicity-golden-globe-awards-arts-and-entertainment-2bc2531d105cd4e095119a62de57f9bd">was expelled in 2021</a> after calling Black Lives Matter “a racist hate movement.”</p><p>“I just hope that we can regain his trust over time,” Hoehne said of Fraser.</p><div id="96d6dcc4556544d2bdd65950349e0f29" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>The same, Hoehne said, goes for Tom Cruise. Last year, he returned his three Golden Globes in protest. With a best picture nod for his long-awaited sequel “Top Gun: Maverick,” he was snubbed for best actor this year.</p><p>Under Boehly's leadership, HFPA members will earn $75,000 a year as his employees, as opposed to current stipends closer to $5,000. They'll vote on nominations and winners among films and television series submitted for awards consideration. They'll write for the organization's website, and organize other projects, the LA Times said, citing a confidential employee memo it reviewed. </p><p>The 103 new voting non-members recruited with the help of the National Association of Black Journalists, Asian-American Journalists Association and LGBTQIA+ organizations will not be paid, setting up a two-tier structure aimed at eliminating the taint of financial compensation as more new recruits come on board.</p><p>Outraged industry stakeholders had called for the overall Globes voting body to be closer to 300. Other reforms are aimed at battling the perception of influence peddling.</p><p>As eventual paid employees, members will be subject to firing without cause. They're now required to sign a code of conduct every year covering job performance, decorum and ethical behavior.</p><p>The 80-year-old group had been stuck in its ways, Hoehne acknowledged.</p><p>“We needed to question a lot of things. We needed to look at these bylaws and say, OK, how can we make them better? How can we modernize the association? We had never really done it and not addressed it,” she said.</p><div id="01abf66739ec4ad29949734e8a88118a" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Although the new pay structure has not yet been implemented, over the past year the HFPA has pushed out several members it accused of violating its standards.</p><p>One was accused of forging signatures on Internal Revenue Service documents, another case related to sexual harassment and a third involved fabricating interviews that never occurred, according to an HFPA spokesperson.</p><p>Boehly himself acknowledged the future is uncertain.</p><p>“I have nightmares where it doesn’t work too, you know? I get it, you can’t convince all of the people all of the time of anything,” he told the LA Times. “We know we have to add value and we know that we have to be part of the solution.”</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press Writer Krysta Fauria contributed to this report. </p><p>___</p><p>Follow Leanne Italie on Twitter at http://twitter.com/litalie</p>]]></description>

Drugstore chains are still trying to find enough employees to put a stop to temporary pharmacy closures. (AP Photo/Chris Carlson)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>Joan Cohrs missed her chance to grab a prescription at her usual drugstore by about 30 seconds.</p><p>Cohrs walked up to the counter of an Indianapolis CVS pharmacy shortly after a metal curtain descended, closing it for lunch. She didn't mind. The 60-year-old said she feels compassion for people in health care.</p><p>“They definitely need a break,” said Cohrs, who was working at an assisted living facility when COVID-19 hit.</p><p>A rush of vaccines, virus tests and a busy flu season started overwhelming pharmacies more than a year ago, forcing many to temporarily close when workers weren't available. </p><p>Major drugstore chains have raised pay and dangled signing bonuses to add employees. They’re also emphasizing the lunch breaks and sending routine prescription work to other locations to improve conditions in their pandemic-battered pharmacies.</p><p>Still, temporary closures persist, and experts say bigger changes are needed.</p><p>“There isn’t a shortage of pharmacists. There’s just a shortage of pharmacists who want to work in those high-stress environments that aren’t adequately resourced,” said Richard Dang, an assistant professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of Southern California.</p><p>Drugstores rely on pharmacists and pharmacy technicians to fill prescriptions, answer phones, work the drive-thru window, administer vaccines and give tests.</p><div id="afs:Card:029281580227" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="7aa39f8227449cc3b4e1bd2d3b130716">Hub peek embed (apf-Health) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>They also ask them to manage a growing amount of patient health. Pharmacists in many stores now help people quit smoking and monitor their blood sugar. And companies like Walgreens are pushing them to work more with primary care doctors. </p><p>Pharmacists also can now test for COVID-19 and then prescribe medicine, a process that might take 20 minutes or more.</p><p>Giving pharmacists a chance to have a bigger impact on public health is “awesome,” said Stefanie Ferreri, a University of North Carolina pharmacy professor. But she added that “the workforce wasn’t quite ready.”</p><p>Pharmacies, like other businesses, were hurt earlier in the pandemic because employees who got COVID-19 — or those in close contact with someone who did — had to miss work for a few days. Stress also left many pharmacists and technicians feeling burned out and looking for other jobs, industry observers say. </p><p>The number of job postings for retail pharmacists rose 63% from 2020 to 2021, according to the Pharmacy Workforce Center, a non-profit that tracks openings.</p><p>Walgreens leaders said Thursday that they added a net total of 600 pharmacists in the recently completed fiscal first quarter. But staff shortages still force the chain to reduce hours at some pharmacies.</p><p>A company representative decline to elaborate, calling it a fluid situation.</p><p>In addition to employee shortages, drugstores also are dealing with thin prescription reimbursement. That makes it hard to raise pay to compete for employees, said Douglas Hoey, CEO of the National Community Pharmacists Association.</p><p>“When just about everything goes up in price, pharmacies are still getting paid as if it was 2019 or 2018,” he said.</p><p>Walgreens is opening processing centers to help fill some of the routine prescriptions that stores get from patients with chronic conditions. Company leaders expect these centers to eventually take over about half the prescription volume from their stores.</p><p>The company also said in October it would eliminate all “task-based" measurements that are part of performance reviews for pharmacy employees.</p><p>CVS Health is trying to spread data entry and prescription verification work to different locations to ease the load at busy stores. </p><p>The company also started emphasizing the half-hour lunch breaks in February.</p><p>Those have limited value, according to Bled Tanoe, a former Walgreens pharmacist in Oklahoma City. She said customers often arrive just before the pharmacy closes, eating into the break time. </p><p>And store employees frequently catch up on work during that break.</p><p>Tanoe, 35, said she left drugstores in 2021 to work at a hospital because the demands were getting “impossible.” She and others say bolder steps are needed to improve the pharmacies. Pharmacists should have the ability to temporarily close counters or cancel some vaccination appointments when workloads get overwhelming, Tanoe said.</p><p>“A pharmacist whose license is on the line has to be the one to navigate and to dictate what is happening in the pharmacy on a daily function,” she said.</p><p>Dang noted that a relatively new California law prevents chain drugstores from establishing quotas for how many prescriptions a pharmacist must fill during a shift. </p><p>He also said drugstores simply need more employees behind the counter if they add services. He noted that the bigger chains are more prone to running drugstores with only one pharmacist.</p><p>At least one has to be on duty for a pharmacy to operate.</p><p>Ferreri would like to see more drugstores set appointments for regulars. That gives pharmacists predictable workloads and more time to fill and check prescriptions. It also reduces trips for customers and can help them keep track of refills. </p><p>These appointments ease stress, said Jessi Stout, owner of Table Rock Pharmacy in Morganton, North Carolina.</p><p>“It’s not like the patient’s in, waiting for you to fill 15 prescriptions at once,” she said.</p><p>One of Stout’s regulars, Debra Bowles, calls the free program “priceless.”</p><p>She refills about six prescriptions every month and has her mom enrolled in a similar program at another pharmacy. </p><p>“It makes taking care of people who cannot take care of themselves much easier,” the 65-year-old said. </p><p>While some pharmacies are changing how they operate, customers also can help. Ferreri recommends giving drugstores a few days to refill a prescription instead of waiting until the last pill. </p><p>Patience also is needed, said Brigid Groves, an executive with the American Pharmacists Association. She said they hear more about customers taking out their frustrations on pharmacy employees over delays or medicine shortages.</p><p>“I think on both sides of the counter, we need to all have grace and realize this is a very challenging and stressful time for everyone,” she said.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

(Jan. 6)</p>    <p>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — A Virginia teacher who was critically injured when she was was shot by a 6-year-old student in Newport News is showing signs of improvement as authorities struggle to understand how a child so young could be involved in a school shooting, the city's mayor said Saturday.</p><p>Newport News Mayor Phillip Jones said the condition of the teacher, a woman in her 30s, is “trending in a positive direction” as she remains hospitalized. Police Chief Steve Drew met with the teacher and her family Saturday morning. “She has improved and is currently listed in stable condition,” police said in a news release.</p><p>The boy shot and wounded the teacher with a handgun in a first-grade classroom on Friday at Richneck Elementary School, according to authorities. Drew said the shooting was not accidental and was part of an altercation. No students were injured. </p><p>Police on Saturday declined to describe what led to the altercation or any other details about what happened in the classroom, citing the ongoing investigation. </p><p>Jones also declined to reveal details of the shooting, or say how the boy got access to the gun or who owns the weapon.</p><p>“This is a red flag for the country," Jones said.</p><p>“I do think that after this event, there is going to be a nationwide discussion on how these sorts of things can be prevented.”</p><div id="afs:Card:849493086589" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="38beb789647975e2f8f0d7c7447eb777">Hub peek embed (Education) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Virginia law does not allow 6-year-olds to be tried as adults. In addition, a 6-year-old is too young to be committed to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice if found guilty.</p><p>A juvenile judge would have authority, though, to revoke a parent’s custody and place a child under the purview of the Department of Social Services. </p><p>Jones would not say where the boy is being held.</p><p>“We are ensuring he has all the services that he currently needs right now,” Jones said.</p><p>Experts who study gun violence said the shooting represents an extremely rare occurrence of a young child bringing a gun into school and wounding a teacher.</p><p>“It’s very rare and it’s not something the legal system is really designed or positioned to deal with,” said researcher David Riedman, founder of a <a href="https://k12ssdb.org/">database</a> that tracks U.S. school shootings dating back to 1970. </p><div id="01b0c7cd2d6543bf8177586dcc33f072" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>He said Saturday that he’s only aware of three other shootings caused by 6-year-old students in the time period he's studied. Those include the fatal shooting of a fellow student in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/e4d184e6ebb0d5859636d05963c2daba">2000 in Michigan</a> and shootings that injured other students in 2011 in Texas and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mississippi-jackson-shootings-5f73a9b46081cf14650e0ec2f3bc065c">2021 in Mississippi. </a></p><p>Riedman said he only knows of one other instance of a student younger than that causing gunfire at a school, in which a 5-year-old student brought a gun to a Tennessee school in 2013 and accidentally discharged it. No one was injured in that case. </p><p>Daniel W. Webster, a professor at Johns Hopkins University who studies gun violence, agreed that a 6-year-old shooting a teacher at school is extremely unusual. But he said his research shows that instances of young children accessing loaded guns and shooting themselves or others unintentionally in homes or other settings are rising. </p><p>“A 6 year old gaining access to a loaded gun and shooting him/herself or someone else, sadly, is not so rare,” he said in an email. </p><p>In the Newport News case, Drew said Friday that the shooting didn't appear to be an accident and that it was isolated to the single victim. He said the student and teacher had known each other in a classroom setting.</p><p>“We did not have a situation where someone was going around the school shooting,” Drew told reporters.</p><p>Investigators were trying to figure out where he obtained the handgun. </p><p>Parents and students were reunited at a gymnasium, Newport News Public Schools said via Facebook.</p><p>The police chief declined to discuss what contact investigators have had with the boy's parents.</p><p>“We have been in contact with our commonwealth’s attorney (local prosecutor) and some other entities to help us best get services to this young man,” Drew said. </p><p>Newport News is a city of about 185,000 people in southeastern Virginia known for its shipyard, which builds the nation's aircraft carriers and other U.S. Navy vessels. </p><p>Richneck has about 550 students who are in kindergarten through fifth grade, according to the Virginia Department of Education’s website. Jones said there will be no classes at the school Monday and Tuesday. </p><p>“Today our students got a lesson in gun violence,” said George Parker III, Newport News schools superintendent, “and what guns can do to disrupt, not only an educational environment, but also a family, a community.” </p><p>___ Associated Press writers Ben Finley in Norfolk, Matthew Barakat in Falls Church and Ed White in Detroit contributed to this report. </p>]]></description>

(Harry: The Interview on ITV1 and ITVX at 9pm on January 8/PA via AP)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>LONDON (AP) — Allies of Britain’s royal family pushed back Saturday against claims made by Prince Harry in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/prince-harry-book-details-ce879703cbc92372e4736313c6cab941">his new memoir,</a> which paints the monarchy as a cold and callous institution that failed to nurture or support him.</p><p>Buckingham Palace hasn't officially commented on the book. But British newspapers and websites brimmed with quotes from unnamed "royal insiders,” rebutting Harry’s accusations. One said his public attacks on the royal family took a “toll” on the health of Queen Elizabeth II, who died in September.</p><p>Veteran journalist Jonathan Dimbleby, a biographer and friend of King Charles III, said Harry’s revelations were the type “that you’d expect … from a sort of B-list celebrity,” and that the king would be pained and frustrated by them.</p><p>“His concern … is to act as head of state for a nation which we all know is in pretty troubled condition,” Dimbleby told the BBC. “I think he will think this gets in the way.“</p><p>Harry’s book, “Spare,” is the latest in a string of very public pronouncements by the prince and his wife Meghan since they <a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-canada-entertainment-celebrities-queen-elizabeth-ii-8cb152f4cdd09fc7d312d86c7e704b87">quit royal life</a> and moved to California in 2020, citing what they saw as the media’s racist treatment of Meghan, who is biracial, and a lack of support from the palace. It follows an interview with Oprah Winfrey and a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/king-charles-iii-entertainment-london-meghan-markle-prince-harry-7d92f6e8db06b2694a386eac01cfd38c">six-part Netflix documentary</a> released last month.</p><div id="afs:Card:930858951867" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="952c0cbaa0c39d18b8338ca651b49394">Hub peek embed (QueenElizabethII) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Harry is not the first British royal to air family secrets — both his parents used the media as their marriage fell apart. Charles cooperated on Dimbleby’s 1994 book and accompanying television documentary, which revealed that the then heir to the throne had had an affair during his marriage to Princess Diana.</p><p>Diana gave her side of the story in a BBC interview the following year, famously saying “there were three of us in this marriage” in reference to Charles’ relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles.</p><p>But “Spare” goes into far more detail about private conversations and personal grievances than any previous royal revelation. </p><p>In the ghostwritten memoir, Harry discusses his grief at the death of his mother in 1997 and his long-simmering resentment at the role of royal “spare,” overshadowed by the “heir” — older brother Prince William. He recounts arguments and a physical altercation with William, reveals how he lost his virginity (in a field) and describes using cocaine and cannabis.</p><p>He also says he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/prince-harry-afghanistan-service-claims-1c497d35a8211dc0366429856a539e2a">killed 25 Taliban fighters</a> while serving as an Apache helicopter pilot in Afghanistan — a claim criticized by both the Taliban and British military veterans.</p><p>“Spare” is due to be published around the world on Tuesday. The Associated Press obtained an early Spanish-language copy.</p><p>Harry has said he expects counterattacks from the palace. He has long complained of “leaks” and “plants” of stories to the media by members of the royal household.</p><p>In an interview due to be broadcast on ITV on Sunday — one of several he has recorded to promote the book — Harry says people who accuse him of invading his family’s privacy “don’t understand or don’t want to believe that my family have been briefing the press.”</p><p>“I don’t know how staying silent is ever going to make things better,” he said.</p>]]></description>

(Amelia Ferrell Knisely via AP)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — A West Virginia journalist lost her job last month after she reported about alleged abuse of people with disabilities within the state agency that runs West Virginia's foster care and psychiatric facilities.</p><p>Amelia Ferrell Knisely, a reporter at West Virginia Public Broadcasting, said she was told to stop reporting on the Department of Health and Human Resources after leaders of the embattled agency “threatened to discredit” the publicly funded television and radio network. She later learned her part-time position was being eliminated.</p><p>In a statement, Knisely said her news director told her the order came from WVPB Executive Director Butch Antolini, former communications director for Republican Gov. Jim Justice. Antolini has served as executive director since 2021, when his predecessor was ousted after Justice overhauled the agency’s governing board. </p><p>Justice has tried unsuccessfully to eliminate state funding for WVPB in the past and was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-government-and-politics-5cabaac7d932d3eb85151c006a11d584">accused of appointing partisan operatives</a> to the board. WVPB receives around $4 million a year in state funding.</p><p>Antolini declined to comment, but other officials denied any effort to influence coverage. West Virginia Educational Broadcasting Authority chairman William H. File III said Antolini told the board “he was not coerced or pressured by anyone."</p><div id="afs:Card:056884756483" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="af942f587d098b2d996cc6e01991d615">Hub peek embed (apf-topnews) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>File said in a statement that Knisely was never fired and remains on the WVPB payroll, though she said her door key and email were deactivated.</p><p>Knisely’s departure comes during a tumultuous time for West Virginia media. Days before she left WVPB, three reporters for the Pulitzer Prize-winning Charleston Gazette-Mail said they were fired after <a href="https://apnews.com/article/twitter-inc-business-west-virginia-charleston-don-blankenship-9c16926c55e137ee7345e38f7fbf2ae9">publicly criticizing an editorial decision</a> by their company president Doug Skaff, who is minority leader in the state House of Delegates. Skaff approved and led a video interview with Don Blankenship, a coal company executive convicted of safety violations connected to one of the worst coal mining disasters in recent U.S. history.</p><p>The departures leave a diminished capitol press corps to cover the upcoming legislative session, which begins Jan. 11. </p><p>Knisely’s stories detailed alleged mistreatment of people with disabilities under state care. The department cares for some of the most vulnerable residents in one of the poorest U.S. states.</p><p>After Knisely’s departure from WVPB was first reported by <a href="https://www.weirtondailytimes.com/news/local-news/2022/12/public-broadcasting-reporter-released-after-dhhr-pressure/">The Parkersburg News and Sentinel</a> last week, both Republican Senate President Craig Blair and Democratic Party Chair Mike Pushkin called the circumstances around her departure “disturbing.” </p><p>Pushkin said Knisely’s coverage of “the glaring issues at DHHR” was “detailed, in depth, and most importantly true.”</p><p>“There’s a very clear difference between not liking what the media reports and actively working to silence them,” Blair wrote on Twitter Dec. 29. </p><p>Knisely was hired as a part-time reporter at WVPB in September. In November, she was copied on an email from then-DHHR Secretary Bill Crouch alleging inaccuracies in a story and asking for a “complete retraction.” </p><p>That never happened, but in early December, Knisely said she was told by WVPB news director Eric Douglas that she could no longer cover DHHR because of threats by state officials to discredit WVPB. </p><p>A week later, amid mounting criticism, Crouch announced he was resigning. </p><p>Douglas confirmed to The Associated Press that he was instructed to tell Knisely she would no longer be reporting on DHHR, and that Antolini directed him to do so. </p><p>As for threats from DHHR officials about discrediting WVPB, he said: “I’d rather not comment on that.” </p><p>On Dec. 15, Knisely filed a human resources complaint about interference with her reporting.</p><p>Things came to a head later that same day over Knisely's press credentials for the 2023 legislative session, according to emails obtained by the AP and first reported by <a href="https://www.weirtondailytimes.com/news/local-news/2022/12/public-broadcasting-reporter-released-after-dhhr-pressure/">The Parkersburg News and Sentinel</a>. </p><p>Douglas initially informed legislative staffers that Knisely would “serve a vital role" in WVPB's 2023 legislative coverage. But then the station's chief operating officer left him off an email saying she wouldn't need credentials after all.</p><p>That troubled Senate spokesperson Jacque Bland, who emailed Douglas to ask about it.</p><p>“It feels kind of gross and shady to me that someone else would dip in and say that one of your reporters won’t have any assignments related to the session,” she wrote.</p><p>She added: “I definitely wanted you to be aware that Butch and Pals were trying to stick their fingers in the pie.”</p><p>Responding the next day, Douglas said he had been pulled into Antolini’s office and told “things had changed with Amelia.” He said he didn’t appreciate WVPB leadership going behind his back, “but for now it is out of my hands.”</p><p>“And you’re right, it does feel gross and shady,” he wrote.</p><p>Knisely said she was informed Dec. 20 that part-time positions were being eliminated. Her email and key card were deactivated around that time. </p><p>This week, Knisely announced on Twitter she was hired by the Beckley-based newspaper The Register-Herald to report on West Virginia's upcoming legislative session. Her coverage will include developments with the state Department of Health and Human Resources, she said. </p>]]></description>

And for the first time in the 31 years of Ukraine’s independence, the service there was held in the Ukrainian language. Ukrainian army troops in uniform were among those singing well-known Ukrainian carols.</p><p>Ukraine's government on Thursday <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-government-moscow-religion-orthodox-church-edafd7fef7f0d12e692a30e56a05ed1b">took over</a> the administration of the Dormition Cathedral at the Kyiv-Pechersk monastery and allowed the Orthodox Church of Ukraine to use it for the Orthodox Christmas service. The move highlights the long-running tensions between the two churches exacerbated by <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine">Russia’s war in Ukraine</a>.</p><p>The cathedral. built about 1,000 years ago then rebuilt in the 1990s after being ruined in World War II, had been under control of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which formerly had ties with the Russian Orthodox Church. </p><div id="afs:Card:521103274690" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="9bea8791e5eda36a0b01cb3b6da86bd5">Hub peek embed (Russia-Ukraine) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“It’s a first victory” for Ukraine, said Oksana Abu-Akel who hailed it as a significant step for Orthodox believers to cut ties with Russia after it started the war more than 10 months ago. “This is the first time in 300 years that there is really our own service here. Every person feels this joy. It is a victory for all Ukrainians.”</p><p>Ukrainian Culture Minister Oleksandr Tkachenko said Thursday that the cathedral had been taken over by the state after the lease of the Moscow-affiliated church expired on Dec. 31. Tkachenko attended the service Saturday.</p><p>“It’s an amazing moment. Previously this place — on Ukrainian territory, within Kyiv — has been linked to Moscow. Now we feel this is ours, this is Ukrainian. This is part of the Ukrainian nation,” said Alex Fesiak, who attended the service. </p><p>In 2019, the Orthodox Church of Ukraine received recognition from the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. Moscow’s and most other Orthodox patriarchs refused to accept that designation that formalized a split with the Russian church. </p><p>The Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC), which remained loyal to the Moscow patriarch since the 17th century, declared independence from Moscow’s Patriarchate after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The UOC gave Moscow a liturgical cold shoulder by dropping the commemoration of Moscow Patriarch Kirill as its leader in public worship and blessing its own sacramental oil rather than use Moscow’s supply. </p><p>Metropolitan Epiphanius, the primate of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, spoke not just about Christmas but delivered a political message about the war.</p><p>“As a nation, we sought to live peacefully, having a good understanding with all our neighbors. But the enemy meanly and treacherously broke the peace and invaded our land, shedding blood, sowing death and wanting to destroy our statehood and our very Ukrainian identity,” he said during the service.</p><p>“Those who held us in captivity could not endure our achievements and our success," he said. "The devil’s malice and envy prompted them to make war, but they are sure to be defeated. After all, the truth is on our side.”</p><p>Natalia Levshyna said her husband couldn’t come to the Christmas service as he is fighting on the front line, but she will send him photos of the service as it's very important to him. Originally from Donbas, she said she stopped attending the church of the Moscow Patriarchate in 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula and supported the conflict in the eastern part of Ukraine.</p><p>"Our emotions are running high,” she said, barely holding back tears, describing her conviction that the Ukrainian church on Ukrainian soil should be independent from the Russian Orthodox Church.</p><p>“Our church must be synchronized with state policy. They must be one,” Levshyna said.</p><p>Others in Ukraine have decided to distance themselves from the Russian Orthodox Church <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-religion-orthodox-church-c8b84fad9dfe93554b2d28b08ec21ada">by celebrating Christmas on Dec. 25. </a></p><p>On Friday, the Church of Moscow Patriarchate condemned the Ukrainian plans to hold a service in the Kyiv cathedral as ”an attempt to forcefully seize ... the cathedral by means of blackmail and misinformation of society.”</p><p>In 2019, the Orthodox Church of Ukraine received recognition from the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, but the Moscow’s patriarch refused to accept that.</p><p>The Ukrainian Orthodox Church declared independence from Moscow’s Patriarchate after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, ending the Ukrainian church's loyalty to the Moscow patriarch which dated back to the 17th century. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church removed Moscow Patriarch Kirill as its leader in public worship and now uses its own sacramental oil for blessings rather than oil supplied by Moscow.</p><p>But Ukrainian security agencies <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-europe-religion-moscow-522129139cfa46c7da0dc0fe3d28f6cb">have claimed</a> that some in the Ukrainian church have maintained close ties with Moscow. They've raided numerous holy sites of the church and later posted photos of rubles, Russian passports and leaflets with messages from the Moscow patriarch as proof that some church officials have been loyal to Moscow.</p><p>Prominent Ukrainian Orthodox Church leaders have rejected the allegations of ties with Moscow, insisting that they have loyally supported Ukraine from the start of the war and that a government crackdown will only hand a propaganda coup to Russia.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine">https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine</a></p><p>___</p><p>This story has been corrected to show that the cathedral was taken over, not the monastery complex, and that the church is Moscow-affiliated, not Moscow-controlled.</p>]]></description>

In Mexico, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's security forces nabbed one of the sons of imprisoned former Sinaloa cartel boss <a href="https://apnews.com/article/latin-america-ap-top-news-us-news-new-york-courts-2b16e1b751b044f3a7581df96ed41ef3">Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán</a>, touching off violence that left 30 dead and dozens injured. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/Ovidio-Guzman-arrested-24bca5ce8544bc151e6c821a37b2be41">The son, Ovidio Guzmán, is a reputed drug trafficker wanted by the United States.</a></p><p>The two presidents, along with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, will gather in Mexico City on Monday and Tuesday for a North American leaders summit. Even with progress on the migration issue, there is much to discuss: climate change, manufacturing, trade, the economy and the potential global clout of a more collaborative North America. </p><p>Biden arrives at the Palacio Nacional in Mexico City on Monday afternoon and the presidents will meet before Trudeau joins them for dinner. Biden and Trudeau will hold talks Tuesday and then the three will gather for discussions. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/b8d2682265be41d7aed559afebaf6c9f">It will be the first time since 2014</a> that Mexico has hosted a U.S. president. </p><div id="afs:Card:130243251955" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="599d640834d079503c5dd568c312c19f">Hub peek embed (JoeBiden) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Biden hopes to use the summit "to keep driving North America's economic competitiveness and help promote inclusive growth and prosperity,” said National Security Council spokesman John Kirby. </p><p>For the U.S., the major talking points are migration, drug trafficking and building on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-technology-business-nevada-environment-and-nature-630a11b14d738335d9d336bc9b51be8e">Biden's push on electric vehicles and manufacturing. </a></p><p>Lopez Obrador is focused on economic integration for North America, supporting the poor in the Americas and regional relationships that put all governments on equal footing.</p><p>The U.S. and Mexico are expected to continue discussions about ending a dispute over U.S. corn after <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-business-mexico-city-general-motors-co-c0df384e0eb07a458ce78f9df28f1bf3">Mexico announced it would ban imports of genetically modified corn.</a> In addition, Mexico is seeking money to boost solar energy projects. </p><p>As for Canada, the goal is simply "to carve some attention and space in this summit,” said Louise Blais, a longtime Canadian diplomat. </p><p>Mexico sees the event as a chance to advance its economic interests. </p><p>It stands to benefit as U.S. companies reconsider their relationships with China after supply chain disruptions, coronavirus outbreaks and changes in federal policy. Both Mexico’s proximity to the U.S. and existing trade agreements would be incentives for American factories to relocate south of the border. The U.S. imported more than $380 billion worth of goods from Mexico through the first 10 months of 2022 — the third-largest source of imports after China and the European Union, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p><p>Canada is the fourth-largest U.S. partner by imports, with the State Department calling it “the world’s most comprehensive trading relationship.” The U.S. and Canada are each other’s largest market for exports, and Canada is the largest foreign supplier of energy products to the U.S.</p><p>The U.S., Mexico and Canada are already in a long-standing trade agreement that was updated in 2020. When U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai met last month with Mexico’s secretary of the economy, Raquel Buenrostro, they discussed further economic integration as well as energy, fisheries and the trade agreement’s ban on importing goods made by forced labor — a subject that is among the tensions with China.</p><p>Analysts at Bank of America estimated in October that Mexico could increase its trade by as much as 30% if more supply chains returned to North America. Their report notes there had already been a bump in Mexican manufacturing as U.S. policymakers and businesses increasingly focus on bringing more trade to allied countries that are near American consumers.</p><p>“Every country is arriving with different priorities, but there is common ground,” said Enrique Perret, managing director of the U.S.-Mexico Foundation, a think tank focused on cooperation between the two nations. “It’s competitiveness, it’s economy, it’s education, it’s labor mobility.” </p><p>But it's not all rosy. </p><p>The leaders of Canada and Mexico have voiced concerns over Biden's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/25/president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-strengthening-buy-american-provisions-ensuring-future-of-america-is-made-in-america-by-all-of-americas-workers/">“Buy America” plan</a>. And while Biden's push toward electric vehicles is a boon to both nations because of the tax credits for North American batteries, there's concern the U.S. allies will be left behind. </p><p>Meantime, the U.S. and Canada accuse López Obrador of trying to favor Mexico’s state-owned utility over power plants built by foreign and private investors, something that is forbidden under the three countries' free trade pact.</p><p>The leaders did meet in Washington last November, but until then, there hadn't been a summit in five years and many of the current disputes have festered despite constant discussion. They include fentanyl trafficking, corn production, automobile rules of origin and Mexican energy laws.</p><p>"These topics are really complicated issues and they will not be solved in a two-day summit," said Carin Zissis of the Americas Society, a nonprofit dedicated to education, debate and dialogue in the Americas. </p><p>The chemistry between Biden and Lopez Obrador is tricky, too. Their relationship is highly transactional and absent any of the warmth and camaraderie Biden has with other world leaders.</p><p>Lopez Obrador has made no secret of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-international-news-global-trade-virus-outbreak-fc583a27741c9d4be4d3b2933cf0ae57">his admiration of Biden's predecessor</a>, Donald Trump. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-caribbean-united-states-electoral-college-mexico-74cf00fdbe55703629bee9f47aac660a">Lopez Obrador did not recognize Biden’s election victory</a> from November 2020 until after the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-270-electoral-college-vote-d429ef97af2bf574d16463384dc7cc1e">formal Electoral College vote</a> a month later.</p><p>Biden has raised concerns over security and drug trafficking in Mexico and the deaths of journalists there. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-covid-politics-health-6efb4c2bde5d080a9ee400a0981f7a61">The U.S. took issue with Lopez Obrador for boycotting</a> the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles last year over Biden's decision not to invite the leaders of Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. </p><p>Biden plans to stop in El Paso, Texas, on Sunday for his first visit as president to the U.S.-Mexico border, just days after announcing that the U.S. will immediately begin turning away Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans who illegally cross into the U.S. from Mexico. The new policy is an effort to manage the spiraling numbers of migrants arriving at the border. </p><p>Mexico agreed each month to take 30,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans and Haitians who walk or swim to the U.S. and are turned back, and the U.S. each month will offer 30,000 people from those four nations work permits for two years and a legal path if they come to the U.S. by plane, have eligible sponsors and pass background checks. People from those four countries now make up the most migrants crossing the border. </p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-mexico-immigration-covid-93d735b9b55c15121c8fc7763fba7e78">Biden's attempt to tackle border security issues</a> has drawn considerable criticism from immigrant advocates and refugee rights groups ,who say the changes are inhumane and reminiscent of Trump's hard-line approach.</p><p>___</p><p>Verza reported from Mexico City.

(Eisai via AP)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — A new Alzheimer’s drug is hitting the market — the first with clear-cut evidence that it can slow, by several months, the mind-robbing disease.</p><p>It's a long-needed new treatment, but experts also are voicing a lot of caution: The drug isn't a cure, it's only intended for early-stage patients, requires IV doses every two weeks, and comes with some safety concerns. </p><p>It's not even clear just how noticeable that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/science-health-business-986f1d9a46a48a50a6b554a6c2950801">modest benefit</a> will be in people's everyday lives.</p><p>Still, “it’s a landmark,” said Dr. Richard Hodes, director of the National Institute on Aging. “It’s not enough, but it’s encouraging that there’s something we can do.”</p><p>Here are some things to know about the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-medication-us-food-and-drug-administration-business-d2a155172735e00d2aa7baaeb8c24a9b">Food and Drug Administration's approval</a> of lecanemab, to be sold under the brand name Leqembi:</p><p>HOW DOES THE NEW DRUG WORK?</p><p>The drug, made by Japan's Eisai and its U.S. partner Biogen, is designed to target and clear away a sticky protein called beta-amyloid that builds up into brain-clogging plaques -- one key hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. </p><p>It targets a slightly different form of that amyloid, possibly explaining why it proved successful in a rigorous study while a long list of prior amyloid-targeting drugs have failed, said Dr. Sam Gandy, an Alzheimer’s expert at New York’s Mount Sinai Hospital.</p><div id="afs:Card:029281580227" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="b42dc8b32d71f1b6892b07d85e0e7da0">Hub peek embed (apf-Health) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>The FDA cleared a similar drug named Aduhelm in 2021 even though studies never proved it really helped patients, a move that triggered scathing criticism from a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-health-us-food-and-drug-administration-medication-dementia-8a4dea09ba183d7f047ee5eb10224289">congressional investigation</a>.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>HOW EFFECTIVE IS IT?</p><p>In Eisai's 18-month study of nearly 1,800 people, Leqembi appeared to delay early-stage patients from getting worse by about five months. </p><p>That was measured on an 18-point scale that tracks cognitive and functional abilities. People who got the drug still worsened but not as rapidly as those given dummy versions — a difference of nearly half a point on that scale by the study's end.</p><p>Experts are divided over how meaningful a benefit that is. It may be hard for families to tell if a loved one's decline has slowed, Gandy said.</p><p>Other experts say slowing the disease early on, when people still function well, is important even if it's not that easy to spot.</p><div id="7c7ceed2303c4d01ba843498ccb583d9" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>“Several months with better cognition, what’s that worth to you?” Hodes asked. “I think there you can get a strong argument: If I can interact with my family, be independent for months ... that’s a very meaningful outcome.”</p><p>WHAT ARE THE RISKS?</p><p>Like other amyloid-targeting medications, Leqembi can cause brain swelling or small brain bleeds. In Eisai's study, 13% of drug recipients had swelling and 17% has small brain bleeds. </p><p>The likely reason: Amyloid plaques usually form around nerve cells in the brain but sometimes the gunk gets inside blood vessels, too. Pulling amyloid out of those blood vessels can weaken them, making them leaky, Gandy explained.</p><p>While the brain swelling and bleeds may cause only minimal symptoms such as dizziness and vision problems, they occasionally can be severe — and several Leqembi users have died while taking the drug, including two who were on blood-thinning medications. </p><p>Eisai has said the deaths can't be attributed to its Alzheimer's drug. But Gandy said the greatest risk of serious bleeding would be among Leqembi users who also take blood thinners, which are commonly used by older adults to prevent or treat strokes.</p><p>Patients also may experience temporary reactions after the infusions that can include fever, flu-like chills, nausea and blood pressure fluctuations.</p><p>WHO IS ELIGIBLE?</p><p>The drug is only intended for people in the very early stages of Alzheimer's who also have that tell-tale amyloid buildup. </p><p>The FDA warned doctors to use caution if they prescribe Leqembi to people who use blood thinners. Patients also will be urged to get brain scans several times over the course of treatment. </p><p>As patients gradually worsen, it's not clear how long they should continue getting the twice-a-month IV infusions. Study participants are being tracked for longer periods, and other research is exploring even earlier use — before people with amyloid buildup show symptoms.</p><p>WHEN WILL IT BE AVAILABLE?</p><p>Eisai says the drug should be available by Jan. 23, but most patients will likely have to wait months to get it.</p><p>That’s because health insurers are expected to scrutinize the drug’s effectiveness before deciding whether to cover it, for which patients, and what testing they may require to confirm they are good candidates.</p><p>And Medicare, which covers most people with Alzheimer’s, is not expected to pay for the drug until later this year. That’s because the plan for seniors only pays for Alzheimer’s drugs that have received full approval from the FDA — while the agency granted Leqembi's approval using a shortcut based on preliminary study results. The FDA is set to review that larger 18-month study soon, in anticipation of full approval later this year.</p><p>HOW MUCH WILL THE DRUG COST?</p><p>The IV drug will cost about $26,500 for a typical year’s worth of treatment. If insurers cover it, most people won't pay anywhere near that much — although people with insurance that requires them to shoulder a larger portion of their drug costs could pay thousands a year.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Greg Abbott</a> that ordered child welfare agents to open abuse investigations into parents who let their children receive gender-affirming care.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>In Tennessee, the GOP-controlled legislature announced after Election Day that its first priority would be to ban medical providers from altering a child’s hormones or performing surgeries that enable them to present as a gender different from their sex. The <a href="https://www.billtrack50.com/billdetail/1496311">pre-filed bill</a> would replace present law with more stringent restrictions.</p><p>The World Professional Association for Transgender Health said last year that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/gender-transition-treatment-guidelines-9dbe54f670a3a0f5f2831c2bf14f9bbb">teens experiencing gender dysphoria</a> can start taking hormones at age 14 and can have certain surgeries at ages 15 or 17. The group acknowledged potential risks but said it was unethical to withhold early treatments, which can improve psychological well-being and reduce suicide risk.</p><p>Legislation pre-filed this week in Republican-controlled Oklahoma, which passed restrictions last year on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sports-oklahoma-oklahoma-city-819e04ae365373b69d8706a6c803dbf7">trans participation in sports</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-oklahoma-b19f921843bfddc0a71b8332946674f7">school bathroom usage</a>, seeks to ban gender-affirming care for patients <a href="https://legiscan.com/OK/text/SB129/2023">under age 26</a> and block it from being covered under the state’s Medicaid program. </p><p>“This is the worst anti-trans bill I have ever seen filed in any state,” Reed said, noting that adult medical transition bans were a “hypothetical escalation” until recently.</p><p>Another Oklahoma proposal would <a href="https://legiscan.com/OK/text/HB1011/2023">prohibit distribution of public funds</a> to organizations that provide gender-affirming procedures to patients younger than 21.</p><p>“It’s irresponsible for anybody in health care to provide or recommend life-altering surgeries that may later be regretted,” said the bill's sponsor, Republican state Rep. Jim Olsen. “Performing irreversible procedures on young people can do irreparable harm to them mentally and physically later in life.”</p><p>A similar bill pre-filed in South Carolina, where Republicans control both chambers, also requires that <a href="https://legiscan.com/SC/text/S0274/2023">trans adults older than 21 obtain referrals</a> from their doctor and a licensed psychiatrist before they can begin treatment.</p><p>Cathy Renna, spokesperson for the National LGBTQ Task Force, said she views these bills as the product of “a permissible climate of hate," driven by disinformation and fearmongering, that made anti-LGBTQ rhetoric more palatable in the years since former President Donald Trump's election in 2016. </p><p>“We have politicians, celebrities and just folks in our communities who were given permission under Trump to kind of pick that scab and do and say harmful things without consequence,” Renna said. “It unleashed a nightmare Pandora’s box of sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, antisemitism.”</p><p>“When you look at the last few years," she said of the LGBTQ community, "we feel like we’re under attack in a way that we have not for decades.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Democrats in some states are taking a more aggressive approach to transgender health protections.</p><p>A new California law, effective as of Jan. 1, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-gender-identity-sacramento-gavin-newsom-1bef273ba60e61a17960eaf8107f37f6">shields families of transgender youth from criminal prosecution</a> if they travel to California for gender-affirming health procedures, such as surgeries or hormone therapy, from states that ban such treatments for minors. Making California a refuge for trans youth and their parents, the law blocks out-of-state subpoenas and prohibits medical providers from sharing information on gender-affirming care with out-of-state entities.</p><p>Another <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB36">California bill</a>, filed in December, would expand those protections by prohibiting a magistrate from issuing an arrest warrant for violating another state’s law that criminalizes helping someone obtain an abortion or gender-affirming care.</p><p>An Illinois lawmaker introduced a similar sanctuary <a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/102/SB/PDF/10200SB4245lv.pdf">bill</a> late last year. The state <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-politics-health-illinois-7fc5b573737c4ac3e6caad21251e1f9b">House passed another bill Friday</a> to increase protections for patients and providers of abortions and gender-affirming treatments.</p><p>And in Minnesota, where <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-politics-minnesota-marijuana-gender-c20c29529364f5a64ee0d68eaf7055a5">Democrats gained a trifecta of state government control</a> in the midterm elections, a new <a href="https://legiscan.com/MN/text/SF63/2023">bill</a> would give the state jurisdiction in child custody cases involving parents who bring their children to Minnesota for gender-affirming health care.</p><p>Reed, a trans woman, is monitoring a growing list of other proposals across statehouses, including drag performance bans, bathroom usage restrictions, limits on LGBTQ discussions in schools and obstacles to changing the gender marker on a driver’s license or birth certificate. But the rising age minimums proposed to access gender-affirming care are among her chief concerns.</p><p>“Adult transition bans are coming into play, and I’m already hearing some talk of, ‘Well, the brain doesn’t finish developing until 25, so why not restrict it until then,’” she said. “Any further loss of autonomy is incredibly concerning.”</p><p>___</p><p>Hannah Schoenbaum, based in Raleigh, North Carolina, is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Ukrainian officials reported Russian shelling attacks in the Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions on Saturday. </p><p>Russia's Defense Ministry insisted Saturday that its forces along the 1,100-kilometer (684-mile) front line were observing the Kremlin-ordered truce, but returned fire when attacked. </p><p>The latest package of U.S. military assistance was the biggest to date for Ukraine. For the first time, it included 50 Bradley armored vehicles and 500 of the anti-tank missiles they can fire. Germany also <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-united-states-government-olaf-scholz-germany-84fc07af2356d8d02adec2e987d06c0a">announced it would supply</a> around 40 Marder armored personnel carriers and France promised <a href="https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-technology-france-government-ukraine-military-0ff505a3c710124e02b3a60becf147e2">wheeled AMX-10 RC tank destroyers.</a></p><div id="afs:Card:521103274690" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="9b3a132b330c90a10e8f031113be241b">Hub peek embed (Russia-Ukraine) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Together, this week's pledges were powerful signals that Ukraine can count on continued long-term Western aid against Russian President Vladimir Putin's drive to dismember the country.</p><p>In his nightly televised address on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed the U.S. aid package as “very powerful.”</p><p>“For the first time, we will get Bradley armored vehicles — this is exactly what is needed. New guns and rounds, including high-precision ones, new rockets, new drones. It is timely and strong,” he said.</p><p>He thanked U.S. President Joe Biden, U.S. lawmakers and “all the Americans who appreciate freedom, and who know that freedom is worth protecting.”</p><p>Celebrated by both Ukrainians and Russians, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/putin-ukraine-government-religion-e0d9f15655e18308c991997f7fc71cf7">the Orthodox Christmas holiday</a> also underscored the enmity that Russia's invasion is precipitating between them.</p><p>In a revered cathedral in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, the Christmas service Saturday was delivered in the Ukrainian language — instead of Russian — for the first time in decades, highlighting how Ukraine is seeking to jettison Moscow's remaining influences over religious, cultural and economic life in the country.</p><p>Ukraine’s government on Thursday took over administration of the Kyiv-Pechersk monastery's Dormition Cathedral from the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which had been loyal to the Russian Orthodox Church, and allowed the Ukrainian church to use it for the Christmas service.</p><p>The monastery complex is a UNESCO World Heritage site. The cathedral was built about 1,000 years ago, then reconstructed in the 1990s after being ruined in World War II. </p><p>“It’s an amazing moment," said Alex Fesiak, among hundreds of worshippers who attended. “Previously this place — on Ukrainian territory, within Kyiv — has been linked to Moscow. Now we feel this is ours, this is Ukrainian. This is part of the Ukrainian nation.” </p><p>The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kyiv-russia-ukraine-war-government-7a4df498707bb047d2a322005c861fd0">Putin-ordered Christmas cease-fire</a> that started Friday was first proposed by the Russian Orthodox Church's Kremlin-aligned head, Patriarch Kirill. The Orthodox Church uses the Julian calendar and celebrates Christmas on Jan. 7. Putin's order said a cease-fire would allow worshippers in combat zones to attend Christmas services. </p><p>But Ukrainian officials didn't commit to following it and dismissed the move as a Russian ploy to buy time for its struggling invasion forces to regroup. Ukrainian and Western officials portrayed the announcement as a Russian attempt to grab the moral high ground and possibly snatch battlefield initiative and momentum from Ukrainian forces amid their counteroffensive of recent months.</p><p>The pause was due to end Saturday night — at midnight Moscow time, which is 11 p.m. in Kyiv. </p><p>The Ministry of Defense in Britain, a leading supplier of military aid to Ukraine, said Saturday in its daily readout on the invasion that “fighting has continued at a routine level into the Orthodox Christmas period.” </p><p>In the fiercely contested Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine, regional Gov. Serhiy Haidai reported continued Russian shelling and assaults. Posting Friday on Telegram, Haidai said that in the first three hours of the cease-fire, Russian forces shelled Ukrainian positions 14 times and stormed one settlement three times. The claim couldn't be independently verified.</p><p>Ukrainian authorities on Saturday also reported attacks elsewhere in the previous 24 hours although it wasn't clear whether the fighting was before or after the cease-fire's start. </p><p>The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said Russian forces carried out a missile strike and 20 salvos with rockets, and targeted settlements in the east, northeast and south.</p><p>The head of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region on Saturday reported two civilian deaths the previous day from Russian strikes in the fiercely contested city of Bakhmut and to its north, in Krasna Hora.</p><p>In the southern Kherson region, Gov. Yaroslav Yanushevych said Saturday that Russian forces shelled 39 times on Friday, hitting houses and apartment buildings, as well as a fire station. One person was killed and seven others were wounded.</p><p>___</p><p>John Leicester in Le Pecq, France, and Elise Morton in London, contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP’s coverage of the war at <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine">https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine</a></p><p>___</p><p>This story has been corrected to show that the Ukrainian government took over the cathedral, not the monastery complex.</p>]]></description>

(Jan. 7)</p>    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — It was the extraordinary moment that brought House Republicans to the brink — and ultimately the moment they found their way back.</p><p>Just one vote short of becoming speaker of the House, California <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-house-of-representatives-kevin-mccarthy-us-republican-party-0938c7358f41c83759246f8949ac7c15">Republican Kevin McCarthy</a> stood from his chair and walked down the center aisle to the back of the chamber. It was nearing midnight, and he had already lost 13 votes for speaker over four long days. The room fell almost silent as it became apparent that the GOP leader was now asking — begging, really — the bombastic, blustering, defiant Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz to change his vote from “present” to “McCarthy.”</p><p>Gaetz, who had hurled personal insults at McCarthy just hours earlier on the House floor, said no.</p><p>McCarthy slowly walked back down the aisle, alone, head tilted to the ground. But he turned back around when he heard a scuffle behind him. Alabama Rep. Mike Rogers, a Republican ally of McCarthy, had angrily confronted Gaetz, telling him he would regret his decision. Lawmakers on the floor yelled in disbelief as Rogers was held back by a colleague. </p><p>McCarthy walked back to make sure the argument was over and then returned to his chair, defeated. </p><p>He lost the 14th vote. Allies moved to abruptly adjourn the House, their hoped-for unity seemingly coming apart.</p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="f2a4a42b4845f2413cca5c1b4c6100dd">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Then tempers cooled. And within the hour, McCarthy and his allies had persuaded his other remaining opponents to vote “present” as well, lowering the vote total necessary for McCarthy to win and handing him the speakership by early Saturday morning — after a historic, remarkable and somewhat astonishing week of repeated votes.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“I hope one thing is clear,” McCarthy said when he finally took the gavel after 1 a.m. “I never give up.”</p><p>The chaos on the House floor came exactly two years after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection. During a late-night session after that attack, McCarthy called it the “saddest day I’ve ever had” as a member of Congress. In the days afterward, McCarthy blamed then-President Donald Trump for encouraging his supporters who attacked the building and interrupted the certification of President Joe Biden. But just a few weeks later McCarthy traveled to see Trump in Florida and made amends.</p><div id="5fcb4e62825e400c8fe0c1c0ba6396c0" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>The scene Friday was a different kind of chaos — but it was a full-circle moment for Republicans, who had ceded both chambers of Congress and the presidency to Democrats after the violent insurrection. While many of them denounced Trump at the time, McCarthy’s Florida visit brought him back into the fold, and the former president was working the phones Friday evening, calling Gaetz and the other holdouts.</p><p>“He was with me from the beginning,” McCarthy said after the final vote, noting Trump's phone calls as well.</p><p>While the U.S. House is often raucous, the week’s events were almost surreal: vote after vote, defeat after defeat, and eventual success after picking off seemingly intransigent opponents. </p><p>McCarthy needed two more votes going into the Friday evening tally, which didn’t start until 10 p.m., late enough to provide two of his supporters — one whose wife had given birth that week and another who was ill — time to return to Washington. McCarthy and his allies seemed confident walking in, but as the votes ticked off, it became clear he would be one short.</p><p>Two of McCarthy’s closest lieutenants, North Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry and Louisiana Rep. Garrett Graves, sat on either side of Gaetz during the vote, with Graves at one point on his knees. But Gaetz could only be partially swayed, and stood to say “present” when the roll call reached his name. It wasn’t enough, and McCarthy approached him just before the vote was called, C-SPAN cameras tracking his short journey.</p><p>Gaetz was angrily pointing at McCarthy during the conversation. But Colorado Rep. Ken Buck, a McCarthy supporter who was standing nearby, said the exchange between the two men was pleasant, and that McCarthy just asked him to change his vote. Gaetz said his “present” vote was as far as he was going, Buck said.</p><p>McCarthy said afterward that Gaetz eventually “got everybody there to the point that nobody voted against me,” persuading some of his fellow colleagues to vote “present” as well. In the end, no Republican voted against McCarthy.</p><p>They wanted to “make this conference united and work together,” McCarthy said.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Kevin Freking, Farnoush Amiri and Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report. </p>]]></description>

Braun/The Deseret News via AP)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>ENOCH, Utah (AP) — City leaders in a small Utah town choked up this week as they expressed shock after a murder-suicide carried out by a fellow church member left eight people dead in their close-knit community, including five children who were classmates with their kids. </p><p>Though shocking, family mass killings are an all-too-common tragedy across the country. They've happened nearly every 3.5 weeks for the last two decades on average, according to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mass-killing-index-dashboard-379385321413">a database</a> compiled by USA Today, The Associated Press and Northeastern University.</p><p>Enoch, Utah, is one of more than 30 communities sent reeling by a family mass killing in the last two years, a list that includes communities of wealth and poverty and spares no race or class. A family mass killing — where four or more people were killed, not including the perpetrator — happened each of the last two years in places as large as Houston or as small as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/casa-grande-8e7e270c261ad459a9407725e93faa97">Casa Grande, Arizona</a>, the database shows.</p><p>The circumstances of the killings are myriad: An argument over pandemic stimulus checks <a href="https://apnews.com/article/man-suspected-killing-4-over-stimulus-check-ba4df1d80d81be489dd3b5821cfd5df5">leaves</a> four family members shot dead and two injured in Indianapolis; <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fires-homicide-oklahoma-marilyn-nelson-ad5fc94b5ffa5cc3c1648a25dbe4f040">financial issues</a> lead to authorities finding six children and their parents inside a house set ablaze in Oklahoma; an escalating custody battle in Ohio precedes a man and members of his family shooting the mother of his child and seven of her family members; a father loses his job, piles his wife and kids in the family station wagon and plunges it into the Detroit River.</p><div id="afs:Card:029281580227" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="1e17fba2d7966f7436de96ddc974e530">Hub peek embed (apf-Health) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Motives can remain speculative in family killings in which assailants take their own lives, but police often cite financial or relationship issues as the causes.</p><p>Enoch police are still investigating what led to the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/utah-education-salt-lake-city-03b4048bf195b027b84c3337c676ce7a">deaths</a> discovered Wednesday, but authorities said Tausha Haight had recently filed a divorce petition against her husband Michael, a 42-year-old insurance agent who they believe killed her, their five children and Tausha’s mother, who was staying at the family’s home. </p><p>Officials have not released information on the weapon they believe killed the adults and the children, who ranged in age from 4 to 17. A relative of Tausha Haight <a href="https://apnews.com/article/utah-divorce-suicide-b2742ac684ad5fb4b0b506efac85578b">said</a> Friday that the family was left “vulnerable” after Michael Haight removed guns he and his wife owned in the days before the murder-suicide.</p><p>Police went to the Haight’s home on Wednesday in response to a welfare check call placed when Tausha Haight missed an appointment.</p><p>The news left mothers, fathers, teachers and churchgoers asking a question many communities face in the aftermath of mass shootings: How could this happen here?</p><p>City Councilman Rob Jensen said he was well aware such tragedies happen throughout the country, yet that did little to quell the shock he felt when the killings happened in his town.</p><p>“Especially in a small town, you don’t anticipate this kind of thing. Nobody does,” Jensen said. “Everyone knows this kind of thing can happen. But everyone wants to say that it’s not them.”</p><p>Family mass killings immediately capture the attention of people in a community, but rarely garner the level of national attention received by mass killings at schools, places of worship or restaurants, said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University who has studied familicides and mass killings for decades.</p><p>Fox, who helped compile and maintains the database for the AP and USA Today, said that’s because it doesn’t carry the same kind of fear with the public. He noted police often issue messages saying there is no danger to the public shortly after the killings are discovered.</p><p>“It’s a nice safe community, but family massacres are independent of the crime rate in the local area,” he said. “We are talking about internal factors, and I think that’s why it’s hard for people to see themselves in these situations and why the response is to mourn instead of fear.”</p><p>Family mass killings are in fact the most common type of mass killing, making up about 45% of the 415 mass shootings since 2006, according to the database. They happen twice as frequently as mass shootings in which members of the public are killed.</p><p>Most, but not all, involve handguns, only about a third involve households with a previous occurrence of domestic violence and most of the assailants have no violent history or criminal past, Fox said.</p><p>There is no governmental agency tracking murder-suicides nationally, so a few years ago policy analysts at the Violence Policy Center — a nonprofit educational organization that conducts research and public education on violence in the U.S. — began tracking details from news accounts to produce an annual report. The latest version from 2020 looked at murder-suicides including many mass killings during the first six months of 2019.</p><p>The study found 81% of murder-suicides happened at home and 65% involved intimate partners. The study also found that among murder-suicides where more than three people aside from the assailant were killed, six of the 10 during those six months were incidents in which a person killed their children, partner and themselves.</p><p>Fox said most of the killings fall into two categories. The first is murder by proxy, in which the killer is motivated by anger or resentment and kills the children who are seen as an extension of their partner. The second is suicide by proxy motivated by despondency or depression, most often a job loss, and the assailant kills the children as an extension of themselves.</p><p>"He wants to spare them the misery of living in this awful world," Fox said. “Over the years, there's been an eclipse in community. There was a time decades ago if you had trouble feeding your family or if you had lost your job, neighbors would come over with casseroles and they would offer emotional support. Many people don’t know their neighbors these days.”</p><p>___</p><p>Lauer reported from Philadelphia. </p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Ariel Schalit, Pool, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s new government is little more than a week old but it's already giving the Biden administration headaches.</p><p>Just days into its mandate, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-jerusalem-religion-israel-government-benjamin-netanyahu-a0e43cbddec11549e60754dc8231a222">a controversial member of Netanyahu’s right-wing Cabinet riled U.S. diplomats with a visit to a Jerusalem holy site</a> that some believe may be harbinger of other contentious moves, including vast expansions of Jewish settlement construction on land claimed by the Palestinians.</p><p>And, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-israel-palestinian-territories-government-middle-east-f795eb80d0c96c185cd2a3c6ea81119f">Netanyahu's government adopted punitive measures against the Palestinians</a> that run in direct opposition to several recent Biden moves to boost U.S.-Palestinian relations, including restoring assistance to the Palestinian Authority that had been cut during the Trump administration and allowing Palestinian officials to visit the United States.</p><p>The new government is an unwelcome complication for a Biden national security team seeking to shift attention away from the Middle East and toward rivals like China and Russia. It also comes as Republicans take control of the House of Representatives and are eager to cast Biden as unfriendly to Israel ahead of the 2024 presidential election.</p><p>Bracing for more turmoil, Biden is dispatching his national security adviser to Israel in mid-January in a bid to forestall potentially deepening rifts between his administration and its top Mideast partner. That visit by Jake Sullivan may be followed by other high-level trips to Israel, including one by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, according to administration officials.</p><div id="afs:Card:130243251955" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="67a5be67c720bfa6c85d8d5a3050b65a">Hub peek embed (JoeBiden) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Their message goes beyond warnings about inflaming tensions with Palestinians: It's also about not cozying up with Russia, particularly now that Moscow is relying on Israel's main enemy, Iran, in its war on Ukraine; and not upsetting the delicate Middle East security balance.</p><p>Since Netanyahu won hotly contested elections last year with huge support from the Israeli right, U.S. officials have sought to tamp down predictions of a collision course, saying they will judge his government on actions rather than personalities. Biden himself spoke of his years-long relationship with Netanyahu.</p><p>“I look forward to working with Prime Minister Netanyahu, who has been my friend for decades, to jointly address the many challenges and opportunities facing Israel and the Middle East region, including threats from Iran,” Biden said when Netanyahu took office Dec. 29.</p><p>Yet while Biden and Netanyahu have known each other for years, they are not close. Biden and former Obama administration officials who now work for Biden still harbor resentment toward the prime minister who, during his previous iteration as Israel’s leader, sought to derail their signature foreign policy achievement: the Iran nuclear deal.</p><p>Still, the administration is signaling it will engage with Netanyahu while avoiding more extreme members of his government. That approach wouldn't be unprecedented in the region: The U.S. deals with Lebanon's government while shunning members from the Hezbollah movement, a designated foreign terrorist organization that is nonetheless a domestic political power. But, it would be remarkable for the U.S. to take a similar approach with such a close ally.</p><p>“We will be dealing directly with Prime Minister Netanyahu,” State Department spokesman Ned Price said this week when asked about possible contacts with Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir's, whose visit to the site known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary prompted a major outcry.</p><p>The inclusion of Ben-Gvir, a West Bank settler leader, and other extreme right-wing figures in Netanyahu’s government who are hostile to the Palestinians and opposed to a two-state resolution has put Israel and the United States on opposite paths.</p><p>On Thursday, the deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Robert Wood, at an emergency meeting of the Security Council called by Arab states to condemn Ben-Gvir's holy site visit, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-israel-government-west-bank-jerusalem-82bd322687b21d159074a2f82c6d43ed">underscored Biden's firm support for “the historic status quo,” especially the “Haram Al-Sharif/Temple Mount.” </a></p><p>Wood noted that Netanyahu had pledged to preserve the status quo — “We expect the government of Israel to follow through on that commitment,” he said — and stressed that the administration placed a priority on preserving the possibility of a two-state solution.</p><p>But on Friday, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-israel-palestinian-territories-government-middle-east-f795eb80d0c96c185cd2a3c6ea81119f">Netanyahu’s Security Cabinet approved a series of punitive steps against the Palestinian leadership</a> in retaliation for the Palestinians pushing the U.N.’s highest judicial body to give an opinion on the Israeli occupation of the West Bank.</p><p>Those moves underscored the hardline approach to the Palestinians that Netanyahu's government has promised at a time of rising violence in the occupied territories.</p><p>The Security Cabinet decided to withhold millions of dollars from the Palestinian Authority and transfer those funds to a compensation program for the families of Israeli victims of Palestinian militant attacks. And, it will deny benefits, including travel permits, to Palestinian officials who "are leading the political and legal war against Israel.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Biden's administration is moving in a diametrically opposed direction. Since taking office, the administration has reversed the Trump ban on aid and provided more than $800 million in economic, development, security, and other assistance to the Palestinians and the UN agency for Palestinian refugees.</p><p>In the fall, the State Department obtained a Justice Department opinion that allows Palestinian officials to visit the United States and spend money in the U.S. despite laws barring such travel and transactions and a Supreme Court ruling that Congress has an enforceable role in the foreign policy process.</p><p>The administration “may reasonably assess that being prevented from hosting the PLO delegation in Washington would seriously impair the president’s diplomatic efforts,” the Justice Department said in a little-noticed Oct. 28th opinion.</p><p>Then, exactly one week before Netanyahu took office in late December, the State Department imposed but immediately waived terrorism sanctions against the Palestinian leadership, saying engagement with the Palestinians is a critical U.S. national security interest.</p><p>On Dec. 22, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman notified Congress that she had imposed travel bans on senior leaders of the Palestinian Authority and Palestine Liberation Organization because they “are not in compliance” with requirements to tamp down and publicly condemn terrorist attacks against Israelis. </p><p>But, in the same notification, the State Department said Sherman had waived the travel bans “based on her determination that such a waiver is in the national security interests of the United States.”</p><p>“An enduring and comprehensive peace between Israel and the Palestinians remains a longstanding goal of U.S. foreign policy,” the department said. “A blanket denial of visas to PLO members and PA officials, to include those whose travel to the United States to advance U.S. goals and objectives, is not consistent with the U.S. government’s expressed willingness to partner with the PLO and PA leadership.”</p><p>Despite a more-than-$3 billion annual assistance package to Israel and diplomatic backing in international forums, U.S. sway with Netanyahu appears limited. </p><p>The Biden administration has not yet followed through on its pledge to re-open the U.S. consulate in Jerusalem, which had historically served as the main contact point with the Palestinians, and it has made no move to re-open the Palestinian embassy in Washington. Both facilities were shut down during the Trump administration.</p><p>Alon Liel, a former director-general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, said further U.S. rapprochement with Palestinians may be the only way to influence Netanyahu. “If they really want to inflict pressure (on Israel), Biden tomorrow should say in the coming months, we will consider reopening the Palestinian embassy in Washington. Then they will see the earth shaking here,” Liel said.</p><p>“But there is no sign of that,” he said. “As long as they say, ‘We’re worried about your democracy,’ those words are meaningless because there were so many words. There’s nothing behind the words.”</p><p>___ </p><p>Laurie Kellman contributed from Jerusalem.</p>]]></description>

But analysts predict it won't have any impact on the flow of drugs to the United States.</p><p>It was a display of muscle — helicopter gunships, hundreds of troops and armored vehicles — at the initiation of a possible extradition process rather than a significant step in a homegrown Mexican effort to dismantle one of the country’s most powerful criminal organizations. Perhaps coincidentally, it came just days before U.S President Joe Biden makes the first visit by a U.S. leader in almost a decade.</p><p>López Obrador has made clear throughout the first four years of his six-year term that pursuing drug capos is not his priority. When military forces cornered the younger Guzmán in Culiacan in 2019, the president ordered him freed to avoid loss of life after gunmen started shooting up the city. </p><p>The only other big capture under his administration was the grabbing of a geriatric Rafael Caro Quintero last July — just days after López Obrador met with Biden in the White House. At that point, Caro Quintero carried more symbolic significance for ordering a DEA agent’s murder decades ago than real weight in today’s drug world.</p><p>“Mexico wants to do at least the bare minimum in terms of counter-drug efforts,” said Mike Vigil, the DEA’s former chief of international operations who spent 13 years of his career in Mexico. “I don’t think that this is a sign that there’s going to be closer cooperation, bilateral collaboration, if you will, between the United States and Mexico.”</p><p>While capturing a criminal is a win for justice and rule of law, Vigil said, the impact on what he sees as a “permanent campaign against drugs” is nil. “Really what we need to do here in the United States is we need to do a better job in terms of reducing demand.”</p><div id="c4a19740044f4543bb30cda81f34b1e1" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>That was a key talking point when the U.S. and Mexican governments announced late in 2021 a new Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public Health and Safe Communities, replacing the outdated Merida Initiative. </p><p>The pact was supposed to take a more holistic approach to the scourge of drugs and the deaths they cause on both sides of the border. But underlining the frequent disconnect between diplomatic speech and reality, just two months later the U.S. government announced a $5 million reward for information leading to the capture of any of four of El Chapo’s sons, including Ovidio, signaling the U.S. kingpin strategy was alive and well.</p><p>“The Bicentennial understanding was a change on paper with respect to attacking drug trafficking and violence with a more important focus on what were supposedly public health programs — (but) without any budget,” said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, an associate professor at George Mason University. In reality, “Mexico is bending to the United States’ interests.”</p><p>For decades, the U.S. has nabbed drug kingpins from Mexico, Colombia and points between, but drugs are as available and more deadly in the United States as ever, she said. “The kingpin strategy is a failed strategy.”</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment on Ovidio Guzmán's arrest.</p><p>López Obrador took office in December 2018 after campaigning with a motto of “hugs, not bullets.” He shifted resources to social programs to address what he sees as violence’s root causes, a medium- to long-term approach that did little for a country suffering more than 35,000 homicides per year.</p><p>“Something that has characterized, in my opinion, Mexico’s security policy in recent years is that it isn’t very clear. It has been a bit contradictory,” said Ángelica Durán-Martínez, associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. That ambiguity makes it difficult to determine if there has really been a change, she said.</p><p>López Obrador’s government benefits from the detention of Guzmán in several ways. The arrest eases the armed forces’ humiliation after being forced by cartel gunmen to release him in 2019. It may sooth ill-feelings after his administration strictly limited U.S. anti-drug cooperation two years ago. And it may help diminish perceptions that López Obrador -- who has frequently visited Sinaloa and praised its people — has gone easier on the Sinaloa cartel than on other gangs.</p><p>For four years López Obrador has continued to shred his predecessors’ prosecution of the drug war at every opportunity. Experts say the respite allowed the cartels to get stronger, both in terms of organization and armament.</p><p>Guzmán during that time took a growing role after his father was sentenced to life in prison in the U.S. The younger Guzmán was indicted in Washington on drug trafficking charges along with another brother in 2018. He allegedly controlled a number of methamphetamine labs and was involved as the Sinaloa cartel expanded strongly into fentanyl production.</p><p>Synthetic drugs have been impervious to government eradication efforts, are easier to produce and smuggle, and are much more profitable. </p><p>The Sinaloa cartel hardly missed a beat when Guzmán's father was sent to the U.S., so the capture of one of the so-called “Chapitos,” as the brothers are known, is never going to shake the operation.</p><p>Mexican security analyst Alejandro Hope said the detention of Ovidio Guzman probably came as the result of pressure or information from the U.S. government, and marks the tacit abandonment of López Obrador’s rhetoric about ditching the kingpin strategy.</p><p>For Hope, the detention is depressing, not only because it won’t fundamentally change the Sinaloa cartel’s booming export trade in meth and fentanyl, but because it reveals how little investigation Mexican authorities had done on Guzmán and the cartel since 2019.</p><p>“How great that they got Ovidio, applause, perfect,” Hope said. “What depresses me is that we’ve been at this (drug war) for 16 years, or 40 counting from the (murder of DEA agent Enrique) Camarena, and we still don’t have the ability to investigate.”</p><p>After Guzmán's capture, Mexican officials said he was arrested on an existing U.S. extradition request, as well as for illegal weapons possession and attempted murder at the time they found him. On Friday, Interior Secretary Adán López Hernández said there were other Mexican investigations underway that they couldn’t talk about. </p><p>“We keep betting on the muscle, the military capabilities and not on the ability to investigate,” Hope said.</p>]]></description>

But whether his cardiac arrest could have been prevented is much less certain.</p><p>Doctors say they’re still evaluating what caused Hamlin’s heart to stop after a tackle during Monday night’s game in Cincinnati. One possibility — a fluke type of chest trauma called <a href="https://apnews.com/article/Bills-damar-hamlin-collapse-what-happened-d73a76f2f7f736b652e95896dfaa0900">commotio cordis</a> — is impossible to predict or prevent.</p><p>Existing heart conditions are the most common cause of sudden cardiac arrest in young athletes. Some of them can be detected through tests including EKGs, which measure the heart’s electrical activity, and echocardiograms, ultrasound imaging exams that show how the heart muscle and valves are working. </p><p>These tests can’t detect all heart conditions and sometimes overlook ones that can be deadly. They are routine in professional sports and used by about half of NCAA programs, said Dr. Andrew Peterson, a team physician for the University of Iowa.</p><p>The American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics don’t recommend them for routine use in high school and youth sports because false-positive results would exclude too many athletes, Peterson said.</p><div id="afs:Card:661046282374" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="0c18b0c970a6af73fd9434a937517475">Hub peek embed (BuffaloBills) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Routine physical exams should include questions about family history of heart disease and worrisome symptoms including fainting episodes, rapid heart rate and chest pain during activity, said Dr. Mariell Jessup, the heart association’s chief medical officer. Cardiac tests would be warranted to investigate those symptoms, she said.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>“It’s possible for somebody to get all the way to adulthood and not have their diagnosis made," she noted. “That particularly happens in populations that are under-resourced or don’t have the ability to see a physician on a regular basis."</p><p>Hamlin’s health history has not been made public. The 24-year-old Buffalo Bills safety remains hospitalized, but doctors say he's making remarkable <a href="https://apnews.com/article/bills-damar-hamlin-health-update-b1edba1849b580c3cd9ec2ea39a85d1e">progress</a>, talking and breathing on his own.</p><p>Jessup said Hamlin “was extraordinarily lucky that there were people around who knew CPR” and that it was started right away.</p><p>He also benefited from the NFL’s routine emergency medical <a href="https://www.nfl.com/playerhealthandsafety/health-and-wellness/player-care/the-60-minutes-meeting-a-critical-game-day-checkpoint">drills</a> held at stadiums before each game. </p><p>“The meeting is an essential checkpoint to ensure officials, team medical staff and gameday medical personnel are aware of all in-game player health and safety procedures and resources,’’ according to online NFL player health and safety information.</p><p>Sudden cardiac arrest is among the things for which they try to prepare. It is the leading medical cause of death in young athletes, though it is rare, with an estimated 1 sudden cardiac death in 50,000 to 80,000 young athletes each year.</p><p>A rare cause of these deaths is commotio cordis, which occurs when someone receives a sharp blow to the chest in a certain spot during a specific time of the heart's rhythm cycle. The trauma causes the heart to quiver and stop pumping blood efficiently. It used to be nearly always fatal but awareness has improved survival to about 60%, said Dr. Mark Link of UT Southwestern Medical Center in Texas.</p><p>One of the most common heart conditions involved in athlete cardiac arrests can often be detected in echocardiograms. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetic condition that can cause part of the heart muscle to thicken, making it harder for the heart to pump blood. Affected people don’t always have symptoms and often go undiagnosed.</p><p>Former Baylor basketball player King McClure had no idea he was affected until he had a EKG and echocardiogram at the start of his freshman year in 2015. </p><p>The diagnosis was devastating: Doctors said he could die if he continued playing. One physician offered an option — an implanted defibrillator that shocks the heart to restore normal heartbeats.</p><p>The implanted device “has never activated, by the grace of God," said McClure, now 26 and an ESPN analyst.</p><p>McClure said he saw Hamlin’s collapse and thought, “that could have been me. When you see things like that that hit so close to home, it kind of scares you," he said. “I’m just thankful that Hamlin is OK and that he’s still here."</p><p>Julie West, of La Porte, Indiana, became an advocate for routine heart testing in schools, more widespread use of automated external defibrillators and routine cardiac emergency drills after her 17-year-old son, Jake, died of sudden cardiac arrest during football practice in 2013. </p><p>“For Jake, no one really knew what to do right away,’’ she said. “The AED was in the coach’s office. The coaches stepped in and did CPR," but it was too late.</p><p>AED awareness has increased since then, and AED procedures are emphasized at almost all level of sport, even high schools.</p><p>“It is part of our CPR renewal course,” said Eric McCauliffe, the girls varsity basketball coach at Indian Lake-Long Lake in upstate New York. “We absolutely run through it and quiz coaches on the locations of AEDs at each school as well.”</p><p>An autopsy revealed Jake had a rare hereditary heart condition that didn’t cause symptoms and wasn't picked up during routine physical exams. His sister later had testing that revealed she has the same condition and she now wears an implanted defibrillator.</p><p>West was a teacher when Jake died and says she was trained for active shooters and fires, but not cardiac arrests.</p><p>“If they don’t have a cardiac response plan, they’re not prepared," she said.</p><p>She formed a foundation that organizes EKG and echocardiogram screenings at Indiana schools.</p><p>West knows the tests aren’t perfect, but for her, saving one life is worth it.</p><p>___</p><p>AP sports writers Tim Reynolds, Ron Blum and Ralph Russo contributed.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner at @LindseyTanner.</p><p>___ </p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Anger was also vented over the requirement that anyone who potentially tested positive or had been in contact with such a person be confined for observation in a field hospital, where overcrowding, poor food and hygiene were commonly cited. </p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="3259cdf2fb41e8dd3d64f6c6d3b7cc80">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The social and economic costs eventually prompted rare street protests in Beijing and other cities, possibly influencing the party's decision to swiftly ease the strictest measures. </p><p>As part of the latest changes, China will also no longer bring criminal charges against people accused of violating border quarantine regulations, according to a notice issued by five government departments on Saturday. </p><p>Individuals currently in custody will be released and seized assets returned, the notice said. </p><p>The adjustments “were made after comprehensively considering the harm of the behaviors to the society, and aim to adapt to the new situations of the epidemic prevention and control," the official China Daily newspaper website said in a report on the notice. </p><p>China is now facing a surge in cases and hospitalizations in major cities and is bracing for a further spread into less developed areas <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-health-china-government-philippines-89822deed22950db4e9b6c5e9c675414">with the start of the Lunar New Year travel rush,</a> set to get underway in coming days. While international flights are still reduced, authorities say they expect domestic rail and air journeys will double over the same period last year, bringing overall numbers close to those of the 2019 holiday period before the pandemic hit.</p><p>The Transportation Ministry on Friday called on travelers to reduce trips and gatherings, particularly if they involve elderly people, pregnant women, small children and those with underlying conditions.</p><p>People using public transport are also urged to wear masks and pay special attention to their health and personal hygiene, Vice Minister Xu Chengguang told reporters at a briefing. </p><p>Nonetheless, China is forging ahead with a plan to end mandatory quarantines for people arriving from abroad beginning on Sunday. </p><p>Beijing also plans to drop a requirement for students at city schools to have a negative COVID-19 test to enter campus when classes resume Feb. 13 after the holiday break. While schools will be allowed to move classes online in the event of new outbreaks, they must return to in-person instruction as soon as possible, the city education bureau said in a statement Friday.</p><p>However, the end to mass testing, a highly limited amount of basic data such as the number of deaths, infections and severe cases, and the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/science-health-china-covid-306b688d84e31a9462f82d0ead1f4584">potential emergence of new variants</a> have prompted governments elsewhere to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-health-europe-european-union-beijing-5085b8ac7a6e773db5a96de63e978b45">institute virus testing requirements</a> for travelers from China. </p><p>The World Health Organization has also expressed concern about the lack of data from China, while the U.S. is requiring a negative test result for travelers from China within 48 hours of departure.</p><p>Chinese health authorities publish a daily count of new cases, severe cases and deaths, but those numbers include only officially confirmed cases and use a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-china-covid-d130817ed350e805295ee16c50ae6a46">very narrow definition of COVID-related deaths. </a></p><p>Authorities say that since the government ended compulsory testing and permitted people with mild symptoms to test themselves and convalesce at home, it can no longer provide a full picture of the state of the latest outbreak. </p><p>On Saturday, the National Health Commission reported 10,681 new domestic cases, bringing the country's total number of confirmed cases to 482,057. Three new deaths were also reported over the previous 24 hours, bringing the total to 5,267. </p><p>The numbers are a fraction of those announced by the U.S., which has put its death toll at more than 1 million among some 101 million cases. </p><p>But they're also much smaller than the estimates being released by some local governments. Zhejiang, a province on the east coast, said Tuesday it was seeing about 1 million new cases a day.</p><p>China has said the testing requirements being imposed by foreign governments — most recently Germany and Sweden — aren’t science-based and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-health-china-government-beijing-762d314d452875ecc525d5c21dbfa541">has threatened unspecified countermeasures.</a> Its spokespeople have said the situation is under control, and reject accusations of a lack of preparation for reopening.</p><p>Despite such assertions, the Health Commission on Saturday rolled out regulations for strengthened monitoring of viral mutations, including testing of urban wastewater. The lengthy rules called for increased data gathering from hospitals and local government health departments and stepped-up checks on “pneumonia of unknown causes." </p><p>If a variant emerges in an outbreak, it is found through genetic sequencing of the virus. </p><p>Since the pandemic started, China has shared 4,144 sequences with GISAID, a global platform for coronavirus data. That’s only 0.04% of its reported number of cases — a rate more than 100 times less than the United States and nearly four times less than neighboring Mongolia.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hong Kong also plans to reopen some of its border crossings with mainland China on Sunday and allow tens of thousands of people to cross every day without being quarantined. </p><p>The semi-autonomous southern Chinese city has been hard-hit by the virus and its land and sea border checkpoints with the mainland have been largely closed for almost three years. Despite the risk, the reopening is expected to provide a much-needed boost to Hong Kong’s tourism and retail sectors.</p><p>___</p><p>This story has been corrected to show that China's latest figures on cases and deaths were released on Saturday instead of Sunday.</p>]]></description>

Braun/The Deseret News via AP)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>ENOCH, Utah (AP) — A Utah man who fatally shot his five children, mother-in-law and wife and then killed himself removed guns owned by himself and his wife days before the murder-suicide, leaving the family “vulnerable,” a relative said Friday.</p><p>The wife, Tausha Haight, told her extended family that her husband, Mike Haight, took the guns from the family's home this week, just two weeks after she had filed for divorce, sister-in-law Jennie Earl told The Associated Press. </p><p>She said she did not know how Tausha Haight felt about the removal but said it “left the family vulnerable,” noting that both Tausha and her mother, Gail Earl, were trained in gun safety and personal protection. Jennie Earl's comments came after the Earl family issued a statement lamenting <a href="https://apnews.com/article/utah-education-salt-lake-city-03b4048bf195b027b84c3337c676ce7a">the tragedy</a> and revealing that guns had been removed. </p><p>“Protective arms were purposely removed from the home prior to the incident because all adults were properly trained to protect human life,” the Earl family said in a statement. “This is the type of loss that will continue to occur in families, communities and this nation when protective arms are no longer accessible.”</p><p>Enoch city manager Rob Dotson said local law enforcement were not involved, saying in an emailed statement that police “has never had reason and has never had to remove firearms.”</p><div id="afs:Card:566876493982" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="b2742ac684ad5fb4b0b506efac85578b">Hub peek embed (Utah) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The revelation provides more insight into <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-utah-salt-lake-city-fba1af0a07b5d81ddbde4fd58786b8aa">what happened in the days leading up to a shooting</a> in a southern Utah home that occurred after Tausha Haight had filed for divorce on Dec. 21 from her husband of 19 years. </p><p>The victims were found Wednesday when police did a welfare check at the residence, according city officials in Enoch, a small town of about 8,000 people located 245 miles (394 kilometers) south of Salt Lake City.</p><p>Without knowing the details about how the shootings unfolded it is not clear whether having those firearms in the home could have helped stop the bloodshed, Jennie Earl said. However, if either Tausha Haight or Gail Earl had a chance to defend their family, they would have been able to use the guns, she said. </p><p>“They could have because they had the skills to do it,” she said. </p><p>Matt Munson, the attorney representing Michael Haight’s family, did not respond to questions about the firearms in the home but sent a statement from his clients mourning the loss of the family and sending condolences to the Earls.</p><p>The family revealed the information about the guns being removed in a statement issued Friday that also lamented the “unthinkable tragedy” and called on the media and public to refrain from using the shooting for any “advocacy of political agendas.”</p><p>“We would encourage reporting about the value of all human life, the great works of God that can render a forgiving heart, how religion can heal and enlarge our capacity for love, and a return to foundational principles of peace within our nation,” the Earl family wrote. </p><p>Enoch officials have said they are aware of the divorce filing but don't know if that was the motive in the killings.</p><p>Enoch Police Chief Jackson Ames also said this week that officers investigated the 42-year-old man and his family a “couple of years prior,” suggesting possible earlier problems inside the household, but he would not elaborate. </p><p>___</p><p>Slevin reported from Denver.</p>]]></description>

(Jan. 6) AP Video by Brittany Peterson, Production by Eugene Garcia</p>    <p>LAS VEGAS (AP) — Avocados can be tricky. Their ripeness window is so narrow that a slew of memes poke fun at the fine art of deciding when to eat them.</p><p>Dutch entrepreneur Marco Snikkers aims to solve that problem with an avocado scanner unveiled this week at <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/technology">the CES tech show in Las Vegas</a> and designed for use in supermarkets. It uses optical sensing and AI technology to determine ripeness, displaying on a screen whether an avocado is firm or ready to eat.</p><p>Snikkers' startup, OneThird, isn't just trying to reduce frustration in the kitchen. According to the United Nations, about one-third of food is wasted globally. That means all the carbon emitted to grow, ship and distribute that food was for naught. </p><p>“That’s a huge problem,” Snikkers said. “That’s a trillion dollar issue for our world and it has a huge impact on C02 emissions and water usage.”</p><p>OneThird is one of several start-ups at this year’s CES working to solve different components of the problem, from helping the food industry limit what it throws away to offering rapid composting solutions to help keep food scraps out of methane-producing landfills. </p><p>OneThird already works with growers, distributors and others along the supply chain to predict the shelf life of avocados, tomatoes, strawberries and blueberries. It will further expand its ability to determine ripeness for more produce later this year, aiming to help reduce the amount of food that is wasted around the world. And it's testing the consumer-friendly avocado scanner at a supermarket in Canada this month.</p><div id="afs:Card:710305756722" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="0d0e84044c3d5218b10dc032cd2ff3c4">Hub peek embed (apf-technology) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Another Dutch entrepreneur, Olaf van der Veen, is working to empower restaurants to reduce food waste, the majority of which happens in a kitchen before a meal is even served to customers. </p><p>His device, Orbisk, uses a camera positioned over a trash can to scan whatever food is about to be tossed. In addition to seeing the type of food, amount and time of day, “we can see if it’s on a plate, in a pan, on a cutting board, which gives circumstantial information on why it was lost,” van der Veen said. </p><p>Orbisk organizes and shares that insight with the restaurant so they can understand their disposal patterns, helping them save money and reduce food waste, and with it, emissions and water use. </p><div id="7299acb177a344bbad11bcb24b57261e" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>The startup's devices are positioned in commercial kitchens in about 10 European countries, with some clients as far as India. </p><p>He said that even after some surplus food is donated, there's more food waste per restaurant in the U.S. than in Europe. That's why the company is at CES, he said, hoping to expand its nascent market further.</p><p>Reducing the amount of wasted food is preferable, but keeping tossed food out of landfills is the next best option. </p><p>When food scraps are properly composted, they release carbon dioxide as part of the biological process of turning into nutrient-rich soil. When food is trapped in landfills, the decomposition process produces methane — a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-business-prices-oil-and-gas-industry-climate-environment-3a5b7049478ec7161fcbd18f1ebdb0ba">potent greenhouse gas</a> that contributes significantly to global warming because it packs a stronger short-term punch more than 80 times stronger than even carbon dioxide.</p><p>The 2006 London Protocol banned dumping food waste into the ocean, prompting South Korea to set up a system of mandatory composting. While the infrastructure allows the country to properly dispose of nearly all its food waste, residents have to haul bags of food to designated curbside bins. </p><p>Reencle is designed to make that process easier. The metal bin is a hyper-fast composting system showcased at CES this year, and helps households reduce one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of food scraps by 90% volume in just 24 hours. </p><p>While the product has sold tens of thousands of units in South Korea, Reencle’s parent company Hanmi Flexible hopes to expand to overseas markets, marketing director Jinhwi Bang said. </p><p>How is it so fast? The device uses self-replicating microorganisms to turn scraps into compost. Its competitor, Lomi, grinds and dehydrates food scraps, requiring the byproduct to be mixed with soil before composting, whereas Reencle says its byproduct can be composted directly.</p><p>Mark Murray, Executive Director of Californians Against Waste, says he hopes people don’t think advanced technology is needed to be able to compost. </p><p>But he says he understands that not everyone has a yard or a patio, and that “all of the tools in the toolbox have to be on the table.”</p><p>Technology is part of the solution. But Murray says economic incentives and systemic change are the other key components to reducing global food waste.</p><p>“We need to make it more expensive to waste food,” he said. “That’ll create the incentive for commercial enterprises, for restaurants, for stores, for even consumers to invest in systems and technology for making sure that we don’t waste food.”</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

(AP) — A 38-year-old retired NASA satellite is about to fall from the sky.</p><p>NASA said Friday the chance of wreckage falling on anybody is “very low.” Most of the 5,400-pound (2,450-kilogram) satellite will burn up upon reentry, according to NASA. But some pieces are expected to survive.</p><p>The space agency put the odds of injury from falling debris at about 1-in-9,400.</p><p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/langley/retired-nasa-earth-radiation-budget-satellite-to-reenter-atmosphere">The science satellite is expected to come down Sunday night</a>, give or take 17 hours, according to the Defense Department. </p><p>The California-based <a href="https://aerospace.org/reentries/erbs-id-15354">Aerospace Corp.,</a> however is targeting Monday morning, give or take 13 hours, along a track passing over Africa, Asia the Middle East and the westernmost areas of North and South America. </p><p>.The Earth Radiation Budget Satellite, known as ERBS, was launched in 1984 aboard space shuttle Challenger. Although its expected working lifetime was two years, the satellite kept making ozone and other atmospheric measurements until its retirement in 2005. The satellite studied how Earth absorbed and radiated energy from the sun.</p><p>The satellite got a special sendoff from Challenger. America's first woman in space, Sally Ride, released the satellite into orbit using the shuttle's robot arm. That same mission also featured the first spacewalk by a U.S. woman: Kathryn Sullivan.

(January 6)</p>    <p>NEW YORK (AP) — As the cast of “RuPaul's Drag Race” celebrated the new season, they credited the show's creator with popularizing drag and expressed concern about <a href="https://apnews.com/article/government-and-politics-a26e7eee15df0bbc2bb98071b683b1f4">the protests and threats to the performance style</a> at the heart of the long-running series.</p><p>“RuPaul really brought drag into the mainstream, truly made people aware that it's an art form more than anything” contestant Marcia Marcia Marcia told The Associated Press at Thursday's season 15 premiere in New York. The new season starts Friday on MTV. </p><div id="614e9934331441ee8a3cd69587dfc489" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>“I think everyone was like fine with drag for a little bit," said the drag queen with the “Brady Bunch”-inspired name. "And now history is repeating itself and people are speaking out against it, which I think is so silly."</p><p>With a long and rich history, drag — the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/7c583a2f299f41fc9812d8c3937c7d0e">art of dressing as another gender,</a> often for performance — has been attacked by right-wing politicians and activists who have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-drag-queen-story-hour-photo-965766299271">falsely associated</a> it with the “sexualization” and “grooming” of children. In recent months, protesters — sometimes bearing guns — <a href="https://apnews.com/article/drag-story-hour-hosts-e1ad3ff0dd73e2e66d98190d00568a1e">have besieged drag story hours,</a> during which performers read books to children. Bans on children at drag events have been floated. In late November, a shooter at a Colorado Springs nightclub <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-crime-shootings-colorado-springs-774c94125cbad7cf05af2c99b81d42cc">turned a drag queen's birthday party into a massacre</a> and was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/crime-shootings-colorado-hate-crimes-springs-b9be567920a55986c57af59535ac9f61">charged with hate crimes and murder.</a></p><div id="0b92cc90-7820-11ed-a5d8-21960cc7de44" class="related-story-embed"></div><p>Another contestant, Jax, said the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/idaho-boise-2e75509ca56444f71ab494c02d139fc9">threats, protests and hate</a> were “disheartening” but not surprising: “Just like being a person of color, being a minority, growing up in certain communities, it’s something that I’ve had to undergo my entire life.”</p><p>“But we always prevail,” Jax added. "We always prevail and we’re always going to come out on top because we’re on the right side of history and we love what we do and we’re not doing anything to harm anybody. We’re just trying to bring love to everything.”</p><p>To contestant Loosey LaDuca, as well, this is nothing new: “It is really unfortunate that during this time, drag queens have become the new target. But LGBT people are no stranger to being the, you know, the public enemy."</p><p>Meeting threats with caution is fine, LaDuca said, but “we’ll never be scared.”</p><p>Last month, New York City Councilman Erik Bottcher attended a drag story hour in his district. He filmed and posted video of “dozens of homophobic protesters outside with the most disgusting signs verbally attacking the families and the drag queen.” Two days later, he said, anti-drag activists vandalized the hallway outside his office and gained entry to his apartment building.</p><p>“Two of them were arrested. A third was arrested for assaulting one of my neighbors," he told the AP at the premiere. "This is all an attempt to intimidate those of us supporting drag story hour.”</p><p>Contestant Irene Dubois has a theory about what's behind the vitriol aimed at drag performers.</p><p>“I think a man in women’s clothing is inherently hilarious just because we're like, (gasps) ‘That’s not supposed to happen!'” Dubois hypothesized. "And it’s when the men in women’s clothing stop sort of doing the nudge, nudge, wink, wink and start actually enjoying the way they look in the women’s clothing that people start to sort of say, ‘Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. You’re supposed to be laughing at yourself. And if you’re not laughing at yourself, we don’t like it.’”</p><p>“RuPaul’s Drag Race” judge Ross Mathews paints the progress and regression as “a pendulum swinging.”</p><p>“The further we advance and the more that we are embraced, accepted, celebrated that pendulum — they’re going to try to swing it back, to move our movement back,” he says of anti-drag activists. “But you cannot put this genie back in the bottle. Darling, we are fabulous.”</p><p>Marcia Marcia Marcia had a simple message for critics of drag, which she says is “all about fun and expression": “If you have a problem with those things, I think you need to reevaluate.”</p><p>In the end, contestant Princess Poppy hopes that it's the impact <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/rupaul">RuPaul</a> has made on culture with “Drag Race” that will prevail. </p><p>“I feel like it’s helped a lot of people who don’t really quite understand drag people or gay people or drag queens," she said. "They don’t really understand because they don’t really understand what we’re doing. But the show, it humanizes us, and it shows that we’re people, too.”</p><div id="afs:Card:958899307023" content-id="264b6f3ce1a161492226616ec6a9f201" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (apf-entertainment) - Compressed layout </div>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Joshua Bessex)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — Whatever happens Sunday, when the Bills close the regular season hosting New England and beyond once the NFL playoffs begin, Buffalo general manager Brandon Beane won’t feel disappointed.</p><p>During a year in which the Bills have endured a snowstorms that disrupted their schedule, mourned the sudden death of tight end Dawson Knox’s younger brother in August, rallied to the community’s support in the aftermath of a mass shooting, and won games with little or no practice, Beane couldn’t be more proud.</p><p>And he has reason to believe the resilience will show once again following a week in which the Bills went from being emotionally stunned by witnessing Damar Hamlin getting resuscitated on the field in Cincinnati on Monday night, to being joyously uplifted after the safety addressed his teammates by videoconference on Friday.</p><p>“I love you boys,” <a href="https://apnews.com/article/bills-damar-hamlin-health-update-b1edba1849b580c3cd9ec2ea39a85d1e">Hamlin said in a soft voice</a>.</p><p>“I probably get emotional if I talk too much about it, but I’m so proud of our organization, our team, just so many people, the way we’ve dealt with so much this year,” Beane said. “Definitely not the way you draw it up. I don’t know what’s gonna happen the rest of season on the field, I really don’t. This is a group of winners, and I will forever remember this team, this season.”</p><div id="afs:Card:234821764243" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="10911df45ebe7be39dadb851f219dd67">Hub peek embed (NFL) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>For Beane, the game Sunday is far more than a showdown against an AFC East rival to close the season. Instead, it represents a celebration of life in knowing Hamlin is on the road to recovery.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The bond the Bills have built in dealing with adversity has brought them even closer in how players and coaches leaned on each other in the aftermath of Hamlin’s collapse.</p><p>“This just put the cherry on top in a positive way,” left tackle Dion Dawkins said. “It has definitely just made (the bond) a permanent glue.”</p><p>As for whether the Bills believe they're physically and emotionally ready to play, quarterback Josh Allen didn’t blink by responding: “I do.”</p><p>Allen then cited the inspiring message Hamlin’s father, Mario, delivered to the team on Wednesday in saying his son would want them to play.</p><p>“He demanded us,” Allen said. “And you can’t not honor his request to go out there and charge forward.”</p><p>The Bills (12-3) are motivated despite having less riding on the outcome of the game than the Patriots (8-8). Buffalo has clinched its third consecutive AFC East title, but has lost the inside track to win the AFC’s top seed. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kansas-city-chiefs-buffalo-bills-indianapolis-colts-cincinnati-bengals-baltimore-ravens-227feaee480e801623ddef15c8dd14f4">The NFL’s decision</a> to cancel Buffalo’s game against Cincinnati pushed Kansas City (13-3) ahead of the Bills in the standings.</p><p>The one consolation is the league ruling the AFC championship game would be played at a neutral site should the Chiefs win the top seed and face Buffalo, should both teams win or lose on Sunday.</p><p>In New England, the Patriots need only to win to clinch their 13th playoff berth in 14 seasons. New England can also clinch a spot should the Dolphins and Steelers lose, and Jacksonville beats Tennessee. </p><p>The Patriots <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-england-patriots-buffalo-bills-sports-transactions-bill-belichick-837880ce24ea212e84abf4529b605735">find themselves in the wild-card race</a> by virtue of a 23-21 win over Miami — and despite losing four of their last six. </p><p>Not lost on coach Bill Belichick <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-england-patriots-buffalo-bills-nfl-sports-bill-belichick-c5dd9fe208bcee4e3795f3f0ace249bf">is the emotional weight</a> that will serve as a backdrop on Sunday, when it comes to Hamlin.</p><p>“Everybody individually will have to process it like we’ve been doing. Expect it be an emotional scene and in the end we’re going there to play our best football game,” Belichick said. “I think everybody understands there’s a balance and there’s multiple things going on there.”</p><p>SHOW OF SUPPORT</p><p>Bills coach Sean McDermott said Belichick was among the many NFL coaches who reached out to him to provide support after Hamlin was hurt.</p><p>“I certainly appreciate his thoughts and prayers,” McDemott said.</p><p>As for game preparation, the Bills essentially held one full practice on Thursday, with Wednesday and Friday’s sessions serving mostly as walkthroughs.</p><p>“It kind of makes you, respectfully, chuckle a little about about what we’ve dealt with,” McDermott said. “Hey, why not make it a short week on top of that.”</p><p>LAST DANCE?</p><p>Sunday’s game could be the final time two of New England's longest tenured players suit up for the Patriots.</p><p>At age 37, special teams captain Matt Slater, on a one-year, $2.6 million contract, is wrapping up his 15th season in New England. Safety Devin McCourty, a 2010 first-round pick out of Rutgers, turned 35 in August after signing a one-year, $9 million deal. </p><p>Slater has appeared in 222 games, which is second only to Tom Brady for the most games played by a Patriots player. McCourty has started all 204 games he’s appeared in, missing just five regular-season games. </p><p>“You never know how football goes. But I’d be lying if I said I didn’t think about it before the game, McCourty said. </p><p>“Just kind of think about that, let that settle in, just trying to make sure I stay in the moment, enjoy. But definitely gave it a few seconds,” he said. </p><p>NO BAILEY </p><p>New England will play its final regular-season game without punter Jake Bailey </p><p>Bailey, a 2020 All-Pro, has been on injured reserve for the last seven games dealing with back issue. He was designated to practice on Dec. 21, but Belichick said on Friday that he will revert to IR and is done for the season. </p><p>Replacement Michael Palardy is averaging just 42.6 yards per punt, ranking at the bottom of the NFL. </p><p>___</p><p>AP Sports Writer Kyle Hightower contributed.</p><p>___</p><p>AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL</p>]]></description>

They are designed to fit into what advanced militaries call a combined arms maneuver fight — the ability to use a wide range of ground, air and other weapons and fighting units in seamless coordination to win a battle.</p><p>The M2A2 Bradley is a medium-armored combat vehicle that has tracks rather than wheels, but is lighter and more agile than a tank. It can carry a crew of three and an additional five or six troops, and is seen as a critical way to move infantry squads safely into battle. </p><div id="afs:Card:521103274690" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="2d59aae94a7ad8a5c22083e77d699417">Hub peek embed (Russia-Ukraine) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>It is generally armed with a 25 mm gun mounted on the top, a machine gun and an anti-tank TOW missile launcher that can be used when the Bradley is stopped. “TOW” stands for “tube-launched, optically tracked, wire-guided,” which means the missile is fired only at targets that troops can actually see on the battlefield, so it's very effective in open spaces such as deserts and large fields. </p><p>The Marder is similar, and can carry largely equivalent weapons.</p><p>In a combined arms fight, for example, Ukrainian forces could fire rounds of artillery and airstrikes into a Russian stronghold, and then quickly move infantry troops in armored vehicles to the front for a ground assault to take advantage of Russia's weakened state. </p><p>“It creates a dilemma for adversaries,” said Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, adding that using the Bradleys will allow Ukraine's forces to exploit soft spots created by the artillery barrages. “It's a powerful combination.”</p><p>Both Russia and Ukraine have suffered heavy losses of tanks and other armored vehicles in the last 10 months, so sending the Bradleys and Marders will help offset those losses.</p><p>WHY NOW?</p><p>The decision to send the Bradleys reflects a steady progression in the complexity and lethality of the weapons systems the U.S. and its allies have provided over the course of the war.</p><p>Many condemn the pace as too slow, arguing that Ukraine needs everything it can get to repel the Russians and that some territory losses could have been prevented if the U.S. and its allies had moved faster.</p><p>Others counter that the types of weapons provided have shifted based on the changing nature of the war since it began last February, and the growing ability of Ukrainian troops to travel out of the country to get the training they need to operate and maintain the more complicated and high-tech systems.</p><p>White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters Friday that the Bradley will be helpful as the fight escalates in the eastern Donbas region, where there is “a lot of farmland, a lot of open ground.” The decision, he said, reflects Ukraine's current military needs, but is “also taking a look at what the fight is likely to be going forward.”</p><p>At the Pentagon, Laura Cooper, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia and Ukraine, said this is the right time to provide Bradleys. “The Ukrainians have demonstrated a lot of growing proficiency in maintenance and sustainment,” she said. She added that the U.S.-led training set to begin later this month will enable troops to operate, maintain and repair the weapons.</p><p>The U.S. and other allies are also using the winter months to send large amounts of weapons and equipment that Ukraine will need when fighting heats up in the spring.</p><p>THANKS BUT NO TANKS</p><p>Ukraine has persistently asked for tanks, but the U.S. and other allies have resisted sending the heavier, more powerful and complex armored vehicles.</p><p>America's M1 Abrams tank, for example, carries a far more powerful gun and is more heavily armored, but weighs a lot more and uses jet fuel, rather than diesel. All of that makes it more difficult to maintain and sustain as troops are on the march. </p><p>“We absolutely agree that Ukraine does need tanks,” said Cooper. “But we have to be cognizant of maintenance and sustainment considerations with tanks. And certainly we know that the Abrams tank, in addition to being a gas guzzler, is quite challenging to maintain.”</p><p>She said that's why the U.S. partnered with the Netherlands to refurbish T-72 Soviet-era tanks that Ukrainian troops would already know how to use.</p><p>The U.S. and other Western nations have trained and practiced for decades on how to move troops in combat so that critical food, fuel and supplies keep pace with the forces. Russia's inability to do that was on display early in the war when its long troop convoy heading toward Kyiv stalled, because troops were without food and fuel due to a total logistical breakdown.</p><p>WHEN WILL THE VEHICLES ARRIVE?</p><p>U.S. and German officials would not provide precise timelines for when the training would finish and how quickly the armored vehicles could arrive in Ukraine.</p><p>The Pentagon has said expanded combat training of Ukrainian forces will begin this month, and Cooper said the Bradley instruction will be built into that. “It will take a couple of months, basically, to get this capability fielded, to get the Ukrainians trained,” she said.</p><p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz had long been wary of pressure to supply the vehicles to Ukraine and insisted Germany wouldn’t go it alone with such deliveries. That led to the tandem announcement with the U.S. commitment this week.</p><p>Scholz’s spokesman, Steffen Hebestreit, told reporters in Berlin that the German vehicles should be ready to go to Ukraine in the first quarter of this year. Germany plans to train Ukrainian forces to use the vehicles, and Hebestreit said experts expect that process to take around eight weeks.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press Writer Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Negotiations to keep about 10,000 New York City nurses from walking off the job headed into a final weekend as some major hospitals were already preparing Friday for a potential strike by sending ambulances elsewhere and transferring some patients, including vulnerable newborns. </p><p>The walkout could start early Monday at several private hospitals, including two of the city's biggest: Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan and Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, each of which has more than 1,000 beds.</p><p>They and a handful of other hospitals are bargaining with nurses who want raises and an end to what they say are untenable staffing squeezes, nearly three years into the coronavirus pandemic. </p><p>“New York City hospitals have violated our trust through years of understaffing, and that understaffing has only gotten worse since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic,” nurses' union President Nancy Hagans said at a news briefing Friday. “It’s time they come to the table and deliver the safe staffing standards that nurses and our patients deserve.”</p><p>Mount Sinai's chief nursing officer, Fran Cartwright, acknowledged nurses are stretched thin. But she pointed to the pandemic's disruptive sweep through people's working lives, at bedsides and beyond.</p><div id="afs:Card:029281580227" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="aa271a346234a352bba7abe67638b55b">Hub peek embed (apf-Health) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“Our nurses are working with patients 24/7, so they’re feeling it, and I’m feeling it with them,” she said in an interview. “It takes years after a pandemic to add stability.”</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>After shouldering health risks and huge workloads at the peak of the virus crisis, the profession is facing <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-business-covid-philanthropy-aarp-b1e359dec146d1c0246cfd9e4a08ac7f">burnout that has driven many nurses into other jobs,</a> or at least away from full-time hospital work. </p><p>Nurses at a Massachusetts hospital <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-business-strikes-massachusetts-115340feea2bd8fa94fc90ab0957ab3c">went on strike for nearly 10 months ending last January</a>, marking the longest nursing walkout in state history. Thousands of nurses at two California hospitals were on strike for a week in May.</p><p>Talks took an acrimonious turn at Mount Sinai, where the union — the New York State Nurses Association — said management had walked away from the bargaining table shortly after midnight and called off negotiations Friday.</p><p>“Shame on you, Mount Sinai,” Hagans said.</p><p>The hospital retorted with a statement accusing the union of being “reckless” and “jeopardizing patients’ care.” </p><p>Mount Sinai said it offered a three-year series of pay raises totaling 19%, matching what the union recently achieved in tentative contract agreements reached with some other hospitals. </p><p>Cartwright said the talks hit a roadblock when management tried to move on to staffing and the union still wanted to discuss salaries. She said management was ready to resume talks once the union was willing to address other issues.</p><p>Mount Sinai said it started canceling some elective surgeries, diverting most ambulances and transferring some patients — including newborns in intensive care — from its flagship hospital and two affiliates, Mount Sinai West and Mount Sinai Morningside. Each has about 500 beds. </p><p>Cartwright said the flagship was “heartbroken” about having to transfer patients, particularly the infants, but would ensure the right care for them and patients who remain. </p><p>Negotiations also continued at Montefiore and the roughly 850-bed BronxCare Health System, while Flushing Hospital Medical Center reached a tentative agreement with nurses Friday evening. Spokespeople for the union and for Flushing Hospital, a 300-bed facility in Queens, confirmed the deal. The union said it included boosts in staffing, plus the same raises — as do the other tentative contracts.</p><p>Spokespeople for Montefiore and BronxCare had no immediate comment Friday. </p><p>BronxCare said Thursday it was confident about eventually reaching an agreement, while Montefiore Senior Vice President Joe Solmonese said nurses were rejecting a “generous” offer. He said it mirrored raises the union had agreed to elsewhere, while also adding 78 more emergency room nurses and making other increases in pay, benefits and staffing.</p><p>On Dec. 30 — a day before their contracts expired — the nurses <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-new-york-city-richmond-strikes-8fbaff93b417ab65abb6fa0bbb2d4217">gave 10 days' notice</a> of an intended strike. Such notice is legally required so hospitals have time to line up temporary replacements.</p><p>One big medical center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-new-york-city-richmond-access-to-care-business-2efedb700fbecbf1fd6871e7e33425c9">reached a tentative agreement</a> with the union the next day. Maimonides and Richmond University medical centers struck tentative deals Wednesday. The union said Maimonides nurses voted Friday to ratify their deal, which Hagans called “the best contract that we have ever had.”</p><p>The nurses are pressing for commitments to what they consider gold-standard staffing levels, such as having at least one nurse for each of the sickest patients in intensive care, and one nurse to about four patients in a typical medical-surgical unit. </p><p>Meanwhile, negotiations also are ongoing with four Brooklyn private hospitals. Nurses there have yet to authorize a strike, though votes are in progress, Hagans said.</p>]]></description>

Reports of scattered fighting in Ukraine on Friday could not immediately be confirmed.</p><p>Kyiv residents ventured out into a light dusting of snow to buy gifts, cakes and groceries for Christmas Eve family celebrations, hours after the cease-fire was to have started.</p><p>In a video message, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised Ukrainians as “united as never before” and lamented that the conflict has forced many to abandon Christmas folk traditions that prohibit sewing and hunting.</p><p>“It is forbidden to sew and knit, but we weave camouflage nets and sew bulletproof vests, overcoming evil. Our ancestors did not go hunting in these days, but we fight so that we do not become prey and to defeat the beast,” he said.</p><div id="afs:Card:238358047997" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="e0d9f15655e18308c991997f7fc71cf7">Hub peek embed (VladimirPutin) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Ukrainians, like Russians and Orthodox in some other countries, conventionally observed Christmas on Jan. 7. But this year, the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, which is not aligned with the Russian church and one of two branches of Orthodoxy in the country, agreed to allow faithful to celebrate on Dec. 25. Many did so, but others held to the old ways.</p><p>Putin attended services at the Annunciation Cathedral, one of several churches on the grounds of the Kremlin.</p><p>In Serbia, observers followed traditions such as the evening burning of dried oak branches and prepared for midnight services in churches, with the main one to be led by the Patriarch, Porfirije, in Belgrade’s biggest church, St. Sava Temple.</p><p>Though most of his traditional Christmas message focused the position of ethnic Serbs in the predominantly ethnic Albanian Kosovo, the Serbian Patriarch said he was praying for the end of the war in Ukraine, which he said is being fueled from outside. </p><p>“It is with sadness that we watch the war conflicts and victims, in which, publicly or secretly, various participants are taking part,” Porfirije said. “The consequences of the tragic, fratricidal conflict, incited on daily basis from outside, are horrible, and the war flames, like never before, are threatening the whole world.”</p><p>The Serbian Orthodox Church has close ties with the Russian church and is highly critical of the West and its policies. </p><p>Bells pealed over the biblical town of Bethlehem on Friday as crowds holding crosses aloft filed through the rain-soaked streets to mark Orthodox Christmas. </p><p>Dozens of boys and girls marched through Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank for the annual scouts parade, playing Palestinian anthems and religious hymns on bagpipes and huge drums. The Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, Theophilos III, joined the faithful as they flocked the Church of the Nativity, revered by Christians as the traditional site of Jesus’s birthplace. Similar celebrations took over the Christian Quarter of Jerusalem’s walled Old City. </p><p>In Egypt, where Coptic Christians make up roughly 10% of the nation’s population of 104 million, one of the year’s most festive holidays was infused with grave uncertainty about the nation’s economy.</p><p>In Cairo’s northern suburb of Shobra and other Christian hubs, golden fairy lights and Christmas-themed decorations adorned the streets. Although Shobra is typically bustling with families buying gifts ahead of Orthodox Christmas, this year shop owners reported a drop in sales. The Egyptian pound has shriveled in value against the dollar, hitting to a new low earlier this week as the country faces a shortage of foreign currency spurred by Russia sending troops into Ukraine. </p><p>During his speech at Coptic Christmas Eve Mass in Cairo, Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi emphasized the harmful impact the fighting in Ukraine was having on the country.</p><p>‘‘The world will be, after the current crisis, different from the world we saw before this. This economic crisis will affect many countries if the war continues this year or longer,’’ el-Sissi said.</p><p>El-Sissi has attended several Christmas Eve services held by the country’s Coptic Orthodox minority, in a public act of interfaith solidarity. In predominantly Muslim Egypt, Coptic Christians make up roughly 10% of the nation’s population of 104 million and face various restrictions, including inter-religious marriages and church building.</p><p>A Christmas mass in Dohuk, in the Kurdish region of Iraq, drew Armenian faithful from across the city.</p><p>Worshippers prayed together and sang hymns in an old stone church, asking for health and peace. Christians once constituted a sizeable minority in Iraq, estimated at around 1.4 million. But their numbers began to fall amid the post-2003 turmoil when Sunni militants often targeted Christians. They received a further blow when the extremist Islamic State group swept through northern Iraq in 2014.</p><p>“I congratulate all Iraqi people from all sects, from the north of the country to the south,” said Sahak Pedros, an Armenian Christian from Baghdad.</p><p>—-=</p><p>Associated Press writers Rashid Yahya in Dohuk, Iraq; Isabel DeBre in Jerusalem; Jalal Bwaitel in Bethlehem, West Bank; and Jovana Gec in Belgrade, Serbia, contributed. </p><p>1</p>]]></description>

(Jan 5-6)</p>    <p>HONOLULU (AP) — Lava from Kilauea spurted high into the air and spread out across about 300 acres (120 hectares) of the Hawaii volcano's summit crater floor, creating a spectacular sight as the mountain began erupting again after a few weeks' hiatus.</p><p>Jillian Marohnic said the pool of lava that formed inside Halemaumau Crater was “the most beautiful” she had ever seen in her 25 years of watching the volcano. </p><p>“The lake was so high. And so full. It’s sparkling,” said Marohnic, who operates the Volcano Hideaways vacation rental business with her husband in the nearby village of Volcano.</p><p>“The surface of the lake looks like stained glass,” she said. </p><p>Kilauea is one of the world's most active volcanoes. This latest eruption began Thursday, less than one month after <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kilauea-volcanoes-climate-and-environment-6d2787e8bdbd4c71e93fc8dda642711d">Kilauea and its larger neighbor Mauna Loa went quiet</a>. Kilauea last erupted from September 2021 through mid-December. Mauna Loa rumbled to life for the first time in 38 years when it erupted for about two weeks starting in late November. </p><p>The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said Kilauea's latest eruption is expected to remain inside the summit crater, which is within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and away from residential communities.</p><div id="afs:Card:149772263397" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="0fd356cfa61a82c7977f88e428ae8200">Hub peek embed (Hawaii) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>The observatory on Thursday raised Kilauea’s alert level, but lowered it the next morning from warning to watch “because the initial high effusion rates are declining, and no infrastructure is threatened.”</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>That is reassuring to Big Island Mayor Mitch Roth. “We’re feeling pretty good about where it’s at right now,” he said Friday.</p><p>The beauty of the eruption is a big draw for visitors.</p><p>John Tarson, who owns EpicLava, a tour company, said he has been “nonstop” talking to tourists who want to see the volcano.</p><p>“A lot of people were on the island and left to go do whatever else they’re doing in Hawaii and then learned about this. And now they’re rerouting all their plans and coming back so that they can see this,” he said. </p><p>On Thursday night, lava from Kilauea shot as high as 164 feet (50 meters) into the air -- roughly as high as the width of a football field -- but most so-called “lava fountains” were smaller, at 32 feet (10 meters) high. </p><div id="a7fcfbdbbc554ba08b884c339ad9c911" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>The crater surface rose 32 feet (10 meters) by 7:30 p.m. Thursday as a result of all the new lava added, the observatory said. </p><p>By morning, the observatory said the lava fountains lost some vigor but were consistently 16 feet (5 meters) high. </p><p>This is typical behavior at the start of Kilauea eruptions, said Matt Patrick, a geologist at the observatory. “This is a cycle of collapse and refilling that Kilauea has done many, many times at its summit,” he said. </p><p>These early days are the best time to see lava on the surface, he said. </p><p>Jody Anastasio, a spokesperson for the national park, said it may be hard to see the lava during the day but there will be a glow at night and all of the park's viewing areas will have good vantage points. </p><p>For Native Hawaiians, volcanic eruptions have deep <a href="https://apnews.com/article/volcanic-eruptions-travel-hawaii-volcanoes-mauna-loa-7ad35f017181d8bcf375a5ccde2f68a3">cultural and spiritual significance</a>.

(Jan. 6)</p>    <p>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) — A 6-year-old student shot and wounded a teacher at his school in Virginia during an altercation inside a first-grade classroom Friday, police and school officials in the city of Newport News said.</p><p>Experts said a school shooting involving a 6-year-old is extremely rare, although not unheard of, while Virginia law limits the ways in which a child that age can be punished for such a crime. </p><p>No students were injured in the shooting at Richneck Elementary School, police said. The teacher — a woman in her 30s — suffered life-threatening injuries. Her condition had improved somewhat by late afternoon, Newport News Police Chief Steve Drew said.</p><p>“We did not have a situation where someone was going around the school shooting,” Drew told reporters, later adding that the gunshot was not an accident.</p><p>Drew said the student and teacher had known each other in a classroom setting.</p><p>He said the boy had a handgun in the classroom, and investigators were trying to figure out where he obtained it. The police chief did not provide further details about the shooting, the altercation or what happened inside the school.</p><p>Joselin Glover, whose son is in fourth grade, <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/crime/vp-nw-richneck-shooting-20230106-bx3uw6mhlzerbosms7zoahdlx4-story.html">told The Virginian-Pilot newspaper</a> she got a text from the school stating that one person was shot and another was in custody.</p><div id="afs:Card:849493086589" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="88dfe91f65173cbbd198a8816a21b5be">Hub peek embed (Education) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“My heart stopped,” she said. “I was freaking out, very nervous. Just wondering if that one person was my son.”</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Carlos, her 9-year-old, was at recess. But he said he and his classmates were soon holed up in the back of a classroom. </p><p>“Most of the whole class was crying,” Carlos told the newspaper.</p><p>Parents and students were reunited at a gymnasium door, Newport News Public Schools said via Facebook.</p><p>The police chief did not specifically address questions about whether authorities were in touch with the boy’s parents, but said members of the police department were handling that investigation. </p><p>“We have been in contact with our commonwealth’s attorney (local prosecutor) and some other entities to help us best get services to this young man,” Drew said. </p><p>Newport News is a city of about 185,000 people in southeastern Virginia known for its shipyard, which builds the nation's aircraft carriers and other U.S. Navy vessels. </p><div id="01b0c7cd2d6543bf8177586dcc33f072" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Richneck has about 550 students who are in kindergarten through fifth grade, according to the Virginia Department of Education’s website. School officials have already said that there will be no classes at the school on Monday. </p><p>“Today our students got a lesson in gun violence,” said George Parker III, Newport News schools superintendent, “and what guns can do to disrupt, not only an educational environment, but also a family, a community.” </p><p>Virginia law does not allow 6-year-olds to be tried as adults. </p><p>In addition, a 6-year-old is too young to be committed to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice if found guilty. </p><p>A juvenile judge would have authority, though, to revoke a parent’s custody and place a child under the purview of the Department of Social Services. </p><p>A school shooting involving a 6-year-old is extremely rare, said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Boston’s Northeastern University. </p><p>Fox told The Associated Press Friday evening that he could think of one previous incident involving a child that age. </p><p>In 2000, a 6-year-old boy fired a bullet from a .32-caliber gun inside Buell Elementary near Flint, Michigan, 60 miles (96 kilometers) from Detroit, striking 6-year-old Kayla Rolland in the neck, <a href="https://www.seacoastonline.com/story/news/2000/03/01/first-grader-shot-killed-by/51309235007/">according to an AP article from the time</a>. She died a half-hour later.</p><p>Fox analyzed school shooting data sets going back to 1970 from the Center for Homeland Defense and Security, which is located at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. He said the data listed school shootings involving children ages 7, 8, 9 and older, but not 6-year-olds. </p><p>Another factor that stands out about the Virginia shooting is that it occurred in a classroom, Fox said. Many occur outside a school building where students are unsupervised.</p><p>From 2010 through 2021, there were more than 800 school-related shootings in K-12 schools that involved 1,149 victims. Thirty percent of those occurred in the school building, said Fox, who published the 2010 book, “Violence and Security on Campus: From Preschool Through College.”</p><p>“There are students who killed teachers, more typically high school students,” Fox said. “I don’t know of other cases where a 6-year-old shot a teacher.” </p><p>___</p><p>Barakat reported from Falls Church, Virginia. </p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Young Kwak)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>MIAMI (AP) — Migrants and asylum seekers fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries have increasingly found that protections in the United States are available to those with money or the savvy to find someone to vouch for them financially. </p><p>President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/biden-restricting-nicaraguans-cubans-haitians-160129177.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9wcm9udG8uYXNzb2NpYXRlZHByZXNzLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAM2n2YiEyceznxtuRP4FmIlBWT7jpznR3YcEDsx5iyCTJBt_UMSMR6yV1-iGSIzd-C7rpduF3jZjb5tJDS-SP1yJQnojLKccCBCOIodzq21vWNsAqOKlx6dpV6-P165nbrg-hdMBbVrTwXlMYkLBy-Uttf0XIuNExzfOe67rdeNk">announced a massive expansion of humanitarian parole Thursday</a> for Cubans, Haitians, Venezuelans and Nicaraguans that is reserved for those who apply online, pay airfare and have a financial sponsor for two years. </p><p>It builds on a measure introduced in October to admit 24,000 Venezuelans to the United States for two years if they have sponsors — and, on the flip side, to quickly expel anyone crossing the border illegally back to Mexico, denying them a chance to seek asylum.</p><p>Maria Antonieta Diaz, a Venezuela-born accountant and entrepreneur living in the U.S for more than two decades, sent a WhatsApp message to former classmates in Venezuela after the Biden administration offered humanitarian parole Oct. 12, asking if they needed a sponsor. She set up a website, circulated a signup sheet and got 40,000 responses from people seeking financial backing, some representing entire families.</p><p>Diaz vouched for a man who came with two adult sons but left behind his wife, a daughter and her spouse and a 6-month-old child because they could not afford $200 passport renewals.</p><div id="afs:Card:130243251955" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="0eb316a474baed22f433359b0644320b">Hub peek embed (JoeBiden) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Many in the U.S. are reluctant to sponsor strangers, fearing they will be on the hook for any debts, Diaz said. </p><p>“It is not easy, it is not a perfect program, not everyone will be able to benefit," Diaz said in a phone interview from her office in Miramar, a suburb northwest of Miami.</p><p>Biden said Thursday that up to 30,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans would be eligible for humanitarian parole every month, entitling them to work in the U.S. for two years. At the same time, Mexico agreed to accept the same number from those four countries who enter the U.S. illegally, even if they come seeking asylum. </p><p>U.S. officials pointed to a 90% drop in Venezuelan arrivals after <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-health-venezuela-caribbean-united-states-d251abc69009e89447cdddf058c162e7">October's policy shift</a>, ending their short-lived status as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-mexico-venezuela-texas-caribbean-ede57e313f6334a019db86b25c785971">the second-largest nationality</a> at the border after Mexicans. The Biden administration granted parole under similar terms to 100,000 Ukrainians after Russia's invasion. </p><p>Asked about limiting parole to those with financial backing, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas didn’t answer directly, saying only that such policies for Venezuelans and Ukrainians succeeded.</p><p>“What we have seen is a tremendous thirst for these lawful programs,” Mayorkas said at a news conference. “We find this to be a humane, lawful and orderly way.” </p><p>Mayorkas said the policy will last as long as conditions dictate, potentially even beyond a pandemic-era rule known as Title 42, under which migrants have been denied a chance to seek asylum under U.S. and international law 2.5 million times on grounds of preventing the spread of COVID-19. The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on Title 42 <a href="https://apnews.com/article/title-42-immigration-limits-supreme-court-updates-0494c30834fad66ce9c6057ea1605d89">in February.</a></p><p>He said U.S. officials are also working on a plan under which people may seek asylum through scheduled appointments at border entry points.</p><p>Guerline Jozef, executive director of Haitian Bridge Alliance, said telling people who are fleeing extreme conditions in their countries to stay put is unacceptable, and questioned how someone in a dire situation traveling through the Americas without a phone or access to an embassy is supposed to use an app to get an appointment to apply for asylum.</p><p>“That is completely disconnected from the reality of people fleeing to seek asylum,” Jozef told reporters Friday.</p><p>Under laws that grew out of World War II and the Cold War, asylum applicants must prove they face persecution at home under limited criteria such as race, political opinion or religious belief, without regard to financial status. Some who arrive at the border will later obtain asylum through the U.S. immigration courts, but not all will qualify.</p><p>Under the parole policy, Homeland Security can admit anyone “on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.” </p><p>Critics to Biden's right, like former top Trump adviser Stephen Miller, called the parole expansion a “mass amnesty.”</p><p>In October, Dr. Kyle Varner of Spokane, Washington, was overwhelmed with hundreds of responses when he posted on Facebook that he was open to sponsoring Venezuelans. He set aside a four-room house that he bought as an investment.</p><p>Varner has backed 49 Venezuelans so far, most of whom he has never seen. Only eight have been approved and settled in Spokane. </p><p>Varner, 38, developed an affinity for Venezuelans as a medical student in Miami in 2012, surrounded by neighbors who left the South American country for a better life. As a doctor, he says he can provide medical care if needed, business contacts to find a job and assistance with online English learning. </p><p>“My idea is that I’m a launching pad for people to have a new life,” he said. “I intend to do everything I can to advocate for the expansion of this program, and I also want to help Americans who want to be sponsors.”</p><p>Few Venezuelans are so lucky to find someone like Varner, who has traveled four times to Cucuta, a Colombian city on Venezuela’s border, to provide free medical care to fleeing Venezuelans. </p><p>Prospective volunteers may hesitate to provide tax returns or other required documents, said Parker Newburn, program coordinator for Home for Refugees, an aid group. Many Venezuelans have relatives in the United States but not all are in a position to sponsor, he said.</p><p>Jenderson Rondón, an opponent of Venezuela's government who met Varner in 2019 at the Colombian border, arrived in Spokane in November. He was unable to afford the flight, which the doctor paid for. He applied to work at restaurants and hospitals and hopes to save enough to sponsor his mother and sister, who are in Colombia and don’t have valid passports. </p><p>“There are lots of people that cannot find a sponsor," said Rondón, who constantly receives messages in his Instagram account asking him about opportunities.</p><p>Venezuelan attorney Henry Nodales, 22, had never met the doctor but they had mutual friends. He borrowed from a friend to pay for the flight and hopes to earn enough to support his parents and sister back home.</p><p>“I have the miraculous opportunity to have legal status, a benefit that many do not have," he said.</p><p>___</p><p>Taxin reported from Orange County, California, and Spagat from San Diego.</p>]]></description>

New York City school officials started blocking this week the impressive but controversial writing tool that can generate paragraphs of human-like text. (AP Photo/Peter Morgan)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>Ask the new artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT to write an essay about the cause of the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-donald-trump-ap-explains-american-civil-war-5e6d77054bef489688519bd400714b65">American Civil War</a> and you can watch it churn out a persuasive term paper in a matter of seconds.</p><p>That's one reason why New York City school officials this week started blocking the impressive but controversial writing tool that can generate paragraphs of human-like text.</p><p>The decision by the largest U.S. school district to restrict the ChatGPT website on school devices and networks could have ripple effects on other schools, and teachers scrambling to figure out how to prevent cheating. The creators of ChatGPT say they're also looking for ways to detect misuse.</p><p>The free tool has been around for just five weeks but is already raising tough questions about the future of AI in education, the tech industry and a host of professions. </p><h2>WHAT IS CHATGPT?</h2><p>ChatGPT launched on Nov. 30 but is part of a broader set of technologies developed by the San Francisco-based startup OpenAI, which has a close relationship with Microsoft. </p><p>It's part of a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-artificial-intelligence-1a652de47c2d0e502c2896748d9d1d5f">new generation of AI systems</a> that can converse, generate readable text on demand and even produce novel images and video based on what they've learned from a vast database of digital books, online writings and other media. </p><p>But unlike previous iterations of so-called “large language models,” such as OpenAI's GPT-3, launched in 2020, the ChatGPT tool is available for free to anyone with an internet connection and designed to be more user-friendly. It works like a written dialogue between the AI system and the person asking it questions.</p><p>Millions of people have played with it over the past month, using it to write silly poems or songs, to try to trick it into making mistakes, or for more practical purposes such as helping compose an email. All of those queries are also helping it get smarter.</p><h2>WHAT ARE THE PITFALLS?</h2><p>As with similar systems, ChatGPT can generate convincing prose, but that doesn't mean what it says is factual or logical.</p><p>Its launch came with little guidance for how to use it, other than a promise that ChatGPT will admit when it's wrong, challenge “incorrect premises” and reject requests meant to generate offensive answers. Since then, however, its popularity has led its creators to try to lower some people's expectations.</p><p>“ChatGPT is incredibly limited, but good enough at some things to create a misleading impression of greatness,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on Twitter in December.</p><p>Altman added that “it’s a mistake to be relying on it for anything important right now." </p><p>"It’s a preview of progress; we have lots of work to do on robustness and truthfulness.”</p><h2>CAN IT BE USED FOR WRITING SCHOOL PAPERS?</h2><p>This is what ChatGPT said when The Associated Press asked it to answer that question in all caps from the perspective of a principal shouting a brief message through a school’s PA system:</p><p>“DO NOT USE CHATGPT OR ANY OTHER AUTOMATED WRITING TOOL FOR SCHOOL PAPERS. THIS IS CHEATING AND WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. IF YOU ARE CAUGHT USING CHATGPT OR ANY OTHER AUTOMATED WRITING TOOL FOR SCHOOL PAPERS, THERE WILL BE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES.”</p><p>But when asked to answer the same question on its own, ChatGPT offered this more measured warning: “As a general rule, it is not appropriate to use ChatGPT or any other automated writing tool for school papers, as it is considered cheating and does not benefit the student in the long run."</p><h2>WHAT DO SCHOOLS SAY? </h2><p>Many school districts are still scrambling to figure out how to set policies on if and how it can be used.</p><p>The New York City education department said Thursday that it's restricting access on school networks and devices because it's worried about negative impacts on student learning, as well as “concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of content.” </p><p>But there’s no stopping a student from accessing ChatGPT from a personal phone or computer at home.</p><p>"While the tool may be able to provide quick and easy answers to questions, it does not build critical-thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for academic and lifelong success,” said schools spokesperson Jenna Lyle.</p><h2>HUMAN OR AI?</h2><p>“To determine if something was written by a human or an AI, you can look for the absence of personal experiences or emotions, check for inconsistency in writing style, and watch for the use of filler words or repetitive phrases. These may be signs that the text was generated by an AI.”</p><p>That’s what ChatGPT told an AP reporter when asked how to tell the difference.</p><p>OpenAI said in a human-written statement this week that it plans to work with educators as it learns from how people are experimenting with ChatGPT in the real world.</p><p>“We don’t want ChatGPT to be used for misleading purposes in schools or anywhere else, so we’re already developing mitigations to help anyone identify text generated by that system,” the company said.</p><h2>DOES THIS THREATEN GOOGLE?</h2><p>There's been some speculation that ChatGPT could upend the internet search business now dominated by Google, but the tech giant has been working on similar technology for years — it's just more cautious about releasing it in the wild.</p><p>It was Google that helped jumpstart the trend for ever-bigger, ever-smarter AI language models that could be “pre-trained” on a wide body of writings. In 2018 the company introduced a system known as BERT that uses a “transformer” technique that compares words across a sentence to predict meaning and context. Some of those advances are now baked into Google searches.</p><p>But there's no question that successive iterations of GPT — which stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer — are having an impact. Microsoft has invested at least $1 billion in OpenAI and has an exclusive license to use GPT-3.</p><h2>HEY CHATGPT, CAN YOU PUT ALL THIS IN A RAP?</h2><p>"ChatGPT’s just a tool,</p><p>But it ain’t no substitute for school.</p><p>You can’t cheat your way to the top,</p><p>Using a machine to do your homework, you’ll flop.</p><p>Plagiarism’s a no-no,</p><p>And ChatGPT’s text is not your own, yo.</p><p>So put in the work, earn that grade,</p><p>Don’t try to cheat, it’s not worth the trade."</p>]]></description>

(Jan. 6)</p>    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. health officials on Friday approved a closely watched Alzheimer’s drug that’s been shown to modestly slow the early stages of the brain-robbing disease, albeit with potential safety risks that doctors and patients will have to carefully weigh.</p><p>The drug, Leqembi, is the first that’s been convincingly shown to slow the decline in memory and thinking that defines Alzheimer’s by targeting the disease's underlying biology. The Food and Drug Administration approved it specifically for patients with mild or early cases of dementia.</p><p>Leqembi, from Japan's Eisai and its U.S. partner Biogen, is a rare success in a field accustomed to failed experimental treatments for the incurable condition. The delay in cognitive decline brought about by the drug likely amounts to just several months, but some experts say it could still meaningfully improve people's lives.</p><p>“This drug is not a cure. It doesn’t stop people from getting worse, but it does measurably slow the progression of the disease,” said Dr. Joy Snider, a neurologist at Washington University in St. Louis. “That might mean someone could have an extra six months to a year of being able to drive.”</p><p>Snider stressed that the medicine, pronounced “leh-KEM-bee,” comes with downsides, including the need for twice-a-month infusions and possible side effects like brain swelling and bleeding.</p><div id="afs:Card:029281580227" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="d2a155172735e00d2aa7baaeb8c24a9b">Hub peek embed (apf-Health) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Approval came via FDA's accelerated pathway, which allows drugs to launch based on early results, before they're confirmed to benefit patients. The agency's use of that shortcut has come under <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-cancer-business-congress-drug-approvals-e029b9f3f72b4282ad39d2d00902edfe">increasing scrutiny</a> from government watchdogs and congressional investigators.</p><p>Last week, a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-health-us-food-and-drug-administration-medication-dementia-8a4dea09ba183d7f047ee5eb10224289">congressional report</a> found that FDA's approval of a similar Alzheimer's drug called <a href="https://apnews.com/article/science-government-and-politics-business-health-2147d824af9cfde629041d83d9ca7a8d">Aduhelm</a> — also from Biogen and Eisai — was “rife with irregularities,” including a number of meetings with drug company staffers that went undocumented.</p><p>Scrutiny of the new drug, known chemically as lecanemab, will likely mean most patients won’t start receiving it for months, as insurers decide whether to cover it and for whom.</p><p>The drug will cost $26,500 for a typical year’s worth of treatment. Eisai said that price reflects the drug’s benefit in terms of improved quality of life, reduced burdens for caregivers and other factors. The company pegged its overall value at $37,000 per year, but said it priced the drug lower to reduce costs for patients and insurers. An independent group that assesses drug value recently said the drug would have to be priced below $20,600 to be cost-effective.</p><div id="7c7ceed2303c4d01ba843498ccb583d9" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Some 6 million people in the U.S. and many more worldwide have Alzheimer’s, which gradually attacks areas of the brain needed for memory, reasoning, communication and daily tasks. </p><p>The FDA's approval was based on one mid-stage study in 850 people with early symptoms of Alzheimer's who also tested positive for a type of brain plaque that is a hallmark of the disease.</p><p>Since then, Eisai has published the results of a larger <a href="https://apnews.com/article/science-health-business-986f1d9a46a48a50a6b554a6c2950801">1,800-patient study</a> that the FDA is expected to soon review to confirm the drug's benefit, setting up a decision on full approval later this year.</p><p>The larger study tracked patients’ results on an 18-point scale that measures memory, judgment and other cognitive abilities. Doctors compile the rating from interviews with the patient and a close contact. After 18 months, patients receiving Leqembi declined more slowly — a difference of less than half a point on the scale — than patients who received a dummy infusion. The delay amounted to just over five months.</p><p>There is little consensus on whether that difference translates into real benefits for patients, such as greater independence.</p><p>“Most patients won’t notice the difference,” said Dr. Matthew Schrag, a neurology researcher at Vanderbilt University. “This is really quite a small effect and probably below the threshold of what we’d call clinically significant.”</p><p>Schrag and some other researchers believe a meaningful improvement would require at least a difference of one full point on the 18-point scale.</p><p>Leqembi works by clearing a sticky brain protein called amyloid that’s a key indicator of Alzheimer’s. But it’s not clear exactly what causes the disease. A string of other amyloid-targeting drugs have failed and many researchers now think combination treatments will be needed.</p><p>Aduhelm, the similar drug, was marred by controversy over its effectiveness.</p><p>The FDA approved that drug in 2021 against the advice of the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/dementia-alzheimers-disease-8ce05b6c22ca4e649d299bb3abafe43a">agency's own outside experts</a>. Doctors hesitated to prescribe the drug and insurers <a href="https://apnews.com/article/science-business-health-4a8cc7650fa1ae1d2796bc7730f3fbb8">restricted coverage</a>.</p><p>The FDA did not consult the same expert panel before approving Leqembi.</p><p>Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut — a frequent FDA critic — said in a statement Friday that she was “deeply concerned that FDA chose to forego" a panel meeting on the drug.</p><p>Schrag said many of the same concerns apply to both drugs.</p><p>“Is this slight, measurable benefit worth the hefty price tag and the side effects patients may experience?” he asked. “I have pretty serious doubts.”</p><p>About 13% of patients in Eisai’s study had swelling of the brain and 17% had small brain bleeds, side effects seen with earlier amyloid-targeting medications. In most cases those problems didn’t cause symptoms, which can include dizziness and vision problems. </p><p>Also, several Leqembi users died while taking the drug, including two who were on blood-thinning medications. Eisai has said the deaths can’t be attributed to the drug. The FDA label warns doctors to use caution if they prescribe Leqembi to patients on blood thinners. </p><p>Insurers are likely to only cover the drug for people like those in the company study — patients with mild dementia and confirmation of amyloid buildup. That typically requires expensive brain scans or a spinal fluid test. Doctors will need to perform a different type of scan to periodically check for brain swelling and bleeding.</p><p>A key question in the drug’s rollout will be insurance coverage by Medicare, the federal health plan that covers 60 million seniors and other Americans. The agency <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-health-medicaid-medication-medicare-78842ee6a557f85861e4e980d96c29d3">severely restricted coverage</a> of Aduhelm, essentially wiping out its U.S. market and prompting Biogen to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/science-business-health-4c25d5aef459f6fff380ff14e354c84b">abandon marketing plans</a> for the drug.</p><p>Eisai executives said they have already spent months discussing their drug's data with Medicare officials. Coverage isn't expected until after the FDA confirms the drug's benefit, expected later this year.</p><p>“Once we have a Medicare decision, then we can truly launch the drug across the country," said Eisai's U.S. CEO, Ivan Cheung.</p><p>Betsy Groves, 73, was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2021. A former lecturer at Harvard’s graduate school of education, she noticed she was having trouble remembering some student names and answering questions.</p><p>Her initial diagnosis, based on a cognitive examination, was later confirmed by a positive test for amyloid.</p><p>Groves, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, says she is “more than willing” to try Leqembi, despite potential side effects and the need for infusions.</p><p>“For me, the minute that drug comes on the market — and I get my doctor’s approval — I’m going to take it,” Groves said.</p><p>___</p><p>AP Medical Writer Lauran Neergaard contributed to this report</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

(Jan 5) (AP video: Terry Chea)</p>    <p>CAPITOLA, Calif. (AP) — California weather calmed Friday but the lull was expected to be brief as more Pacific storms lined up to blast into the state, where successive powerful weather systems have knocked out power to thousands, battered the coastline, flooded streets, toppled trees and caused at least six deaths. </p><p>Remnant showers from the latest storm, a “bomb cyclone,” fell around the state and dangerous surf pounded the coast despite declining wave heights, while some areas enjoyed sunshine. A Southern California pier was damaged by high surf and winds overnight and will remain closed until it is repaired, officials said. Streets flooded in low-lying beach cities.</p><p>The next round of severe weather was predicted to arrive in Northern California on Friday night and spread south into the central region during the weekend, increasing flooding concerns due to already saturated soil. Heavy snow was forecast for the Sierra Nevada. </p><p>“A very active weather pattern across the Pacific Ocean will continue to push energetic and fast-moving low pressure systems toward the West Coast,” the National Weather Service said. “California continues to take the brunt of the heavy precipitation and strong winds associated with these systems as we head into the first full weekend of 2023.”</p><div id="afs:Card:722724375005" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="b83bb05fa2d21796a85be9bfc690cf17">Hub peek embed (Weather) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>During the weekend, “the next moisture-laden Pacific cyclone is forecast to approach California with the next onslaught of heavy rain,” the service said.</p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The storms are atmospheric rivers, long plumes of moisture stretching far out into the Pacific, and capable of dropping staggering amounts of rain and snow.</p><p>Downtown San Francisco had its wettest 10-day period since 1871 between Dec. 26 and Jan. 4 when 10.33 inches (26.24 centimeters) of rain fell. The all-time 10-day record was 14.37 inches (36.5 cm) in January 1862.</p><p>The storms have also been piling up much-needed snow in the drought-stricken state’s mountains, where the snowpack supplies about a third of California’s water supply.</p><p>“It has been a deep week with almost 5 FEET of snow (57.9 inches, 147 cm) falling in the last 7 days!” the UC Berkeley Central Sierra Snow Lab tweeted Friday.</p><div id="a4c8cef34b084115a542ce67c655fad7" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>The statewide snowpack was 191% of normal to date and 76% of the April 1 average, which is usually the peak, according to the California Department of Water Resources. </p><p>Storms have been arriving in California since early November. A powerful New Year’s weekend storm caused extensive flooding in Northern California’s Sacramento County and four deaths. It undermined a massive oak tree that fell Monday and crushed a nursery school in Marin County. The school was empty at the time.</p><p>That storm was followed on Wednesday and Thursday by a “bomb cyclone,” a shorthand reference to a storm intensified by a rapid plunge in air pressure through a process called bombogenesis.</p><p>Two deaths were reported, including a 2-year-old boy killed when a redwood fell on a mobile home. The seaside village of Capitola in Santa Cruz County about 60 miles (100 kilometers) south of San Francisco suffered possibly the worst damage as waves that were forecast to top 25 feet (7.6 meters) crashed into homes and restaurants at the mouth of Soquel Creek and knocked out a section of its historic wooden pier.</p><p>Hurricane-strength gusts as high as 101 mph (162 kph) toppled trees onto buildings and roads, knocked out power lines and blew down the roof on a gas station in South San Francisco. </p><p>National Weather Service meteorologist Warren Blier said the wind speed recorded on a Marin County hilltop was among the highest he could recall in a 25-year career. </p><p>The storms won’t be enough to officially end the state’s ongoing drought, now entering its fourth year, but they have helped. Not including the latest deluge, recent storms moved parts of the state out of the “exceptional drought” category in <a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?West">the U.S. Drought Monitor</a>. Most of the state, though, remains in the extreme or severe drought categories.</p><p>___</p><p>Melley and Antczak reported from Los Angeles.

The Wall Street Journal reported over the summer that McMahon <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-sports-wrestling-sexual-misconduct-vince-mcmahon-1231b28da1b3fcafeea1fc8a8e68d74c">agreed to pay more than $12 million</a> over the past 16 years to suppress allegations of sexual misconduct and infidelity.</p><p>The Stamford, Connecticut, company said Friday that it would be looking at "all strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.”</p><p>There have been rumors that WWE may be interested in selling the organization to another entertainment company. </p><p>McMahon appeared to address that possibility in a letter to the board, dated Dec. 20, but published Friday. </p><p>“I believe WWE has a unique opportunity during this critical juncture to maximize value for its shareholders and all other stakeholders,” McMahon wrote. “Specifically, given the rapidly evolving media landscape in which more and more companies are seeking to own the intellectual property offered on their streaming platforms – I firmly believe that the best thing to do for all of WWE’s shareholders and other stakeholders is to undertake a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives.”</p><div id="afs:Card:857557281710" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="d35dd1b3f197945181c0a3701f9939f5">Hub peek embed (apf-sports) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The company said in early November that an investigation of a special committee formed to look into the misconduct allegations was completed and that the committee was disbanded. </p><p>The company on Friday did not immediately return requests from The Associated Press seeking details about the findings of that committee.

(AP) — Federal judges ordered South Carolina lawmakers to draw new congressional maps, ruling Friday that the U.S. House district lines of a seat flipped by Democrats four years ago were intentionally redrawn to split Black neighborhoods to dilute their voting power.</p><p>The state used the maps in this past November’s midterm elections after the Republican-dominated state Legislature <a href="https://apnews.com/article/congress-south-carolina-columbia-redistricting-4de06139b7892c89a2b4f9df023700cd">redrew the lines earlier this year</a> following the 2020 U.S. Census.</p><p>With Republicans holding a thin margin in the U.S. House, any change to competitive districts has a chance to alter the balance of power after the 2024 elections.</p><p>Friday's ruling said the coastal 1st District running from Charleston to Hilton Head Island was drawn to remove Black voters and make it a safer seat for Republicans.</p><p>The judges requested state lawmakers pass new U.S. House maps by the end of March. They said no elections can take place in the 1st District until it is redrawn.</p><p>South Carolina House Speaker Murrell Smith said he anticipated the decision would be appealed. “I maintain that the House drew maps without racial bias and in the best interest of all the people of this state,” the Republican said in a statement.</p><p>Republican Rep. Nancy Mace currently represents the 1st District. She beat Joe Cunningham in 2020 after Cunningham became the first Democrat to flip a U.S. House seat in South Carolina in 30 years.</p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="9f48c6c7668b7b9404a7a9335d3a195a">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Mace won by just over 1 percentage point in 2020. But after the district was redrawn, she won by 14 percentage points in November.</p><p>After the new congressional maps were approved, civil rights groups swiftly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/congress-naacp-south-carolina-lawsuits-house-elections-eb3c5825d5c9582b708a3c7ddffd541d">filed a lawsuit</a> charging the state Legislature with choosing “perhaps the worst option of the available maps" for Black voters.</p><p>The judges requested state lawmakers pass new U.S. House maps by the end of March. They said no elections can take place in the 1st District until it is redrawn.</p><p>The judges ruled that to make the 1st District safer for Republicans, GOP legislative leaders who drew the new maps pulled Black voters out of the 1st District and placed them into the 6th District, which is the only one represented by a Democrat and was redrawn three decades ago to have a majority of minority voters.</p><p>The 6th District stretches through a large swath of rural South Carolina into Columbia, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) from Charleston.</p><p>The judges wrote in their ruling that Will Roberts, who drew the maps, used race to achieve the partisan goal of making the 1st District safer for Republicans, which is not allowed under federal law.</p><p>“When asked what community of interest the residents of North Charleston would have with the residents of Congressional District No. 6 in Columbia, Roberts could only think of their common proximity to Interstate I-26, albeit over 100 miles apart,” the judges wrote.</p><p>The panel’s decision delivered a victory for civil rights groups after the Supreme Court in 2013 tossed a key provision of the landmark Voting Rights Act. The trial marked the first time South Carolina maps had been scrutinized since the justices removed part of the 1965 law that required the state get federal approval to protect against discriminatory redistricting proposals.</p><p>The judges did OK the split of some African American voters in the 2nd District around Columbia to include U.S. Army training base Fort Jackson in the district represented by Joe Wilson. He is expected to be chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and the district boundaries had been in place for 30 years.</p><p>South Carolina's 5th District also was approved by the judges.</p><p>Attorneys for state lawmakers said their changes were not driven by race, but by South Carolina’s population boom. Much of the state’s 10% population growth from 2010 to 2020 occurred along the coast.</p><p>The General Assembly also argued that the maps were driven not by race but by legitimate political interests like preserving the state’s 6-1 ratio of Republicans to Democrats representing South Carolina in the House of Representatives.</p><p>The decision adds another urgent matter to the General Assembly's session that begins Tuesday.</p><p>“We’ve got a lot of other things that we need to be focusing on,” Republican Gov. Henry McMaster said at a Friday news conference where he was releasing his budget plan.</p><p>—-</p><p>James Pollard is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Food and Agriculture Organization said, as <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine?utm_source=apnewsnav&amp;utm_medium=featured">Russia's war in Ukraine</a>, drought and other factors <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-inflation-africa-poverty-8054cd00098cb475b9dc9679086f7bdb">drove up inflation and worsened hunger worldwide</a>.</p><p>The FAO Food Price Index, which tracks monthly changes in the international prices of commonly traded food commodities, dipped by 1.9% in December from a month earlier, the Rome-based organization said Friday. For the whole year, it averaged 143.7 points, more than 14% above the 2021 average, which also saw large increases.</p><p>The December decline was led by a drop in the price of vegetable oils amid shrinking import demand, expectations of increased soy oil production in South America and lower crude oil prices. Grain and meat were also down, while dairy and sugar rose slightly.</p><p>“Calmer food commodity prices are welcome after <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-health-climate-and-environment-prices-30a5e6557b9fdd54e8d938a17e4f3223">two very volatile years</a>,” FAO chief economist Maximo Torero said in a prepared statement. “It is important to remain vigilant and keep a strong focus on mitigating global food insecurity given that world food prices remain at elevated levels, with many staples near record highs, and with prices of rice increasing, and still many risks associated with future supplies.”</p><div id="afs:Card:323478394356" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="00539505ec5db37de5877137b9febeb8">Hub peek embed (Foodcrisis) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Last year, the U.N. organization's Food Price Index hit the highest level since its records began in 1961, according to FAO data. </p><p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-covid-politics-health-middle-east-58bb99da6bf9fc6af5a5a645022bc4d7">exacerbated a food crisis</a> because the two countries were <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ssia-ukraine-business-africa-lifestyle-middle-east-1b41faaa7ac0984d0673023b68d39a70">leading global suppliers of wheat</a>, barley, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-covid-business-health-africa-688a358195a4723fc862cfe3f9e60474">sunflower oil</a> and other products, especially to nations in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia that were already struggling with hunger. </p><p>With critical Black Sea supplies disrupted, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-health-europe-united-nations-fe2cc912195478f0dd861e6252c8f3b3">food prices rose to record highs</a>, increasing inflation, poverty and food insecurity in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-health-africa-faf7f3f6539d39516515dcc4a39cb452">developing nations that rely on imports</a>.</p><p>The war also jolted energy markets and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-business-health-europe-c6a2d11380d3cb0c48d4c22703d1954e">fertilizer supplies</a>, both key to food production.

Now, as the Bills defensive back remains in critical condition in a Cincinnati hospital, fans are reflecting on their relationship with the sport they love. (AP Photo/John McCoy, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — It was uplifting enough for the Buffalo Bills staff and players to see Damar Hamlin appear on the video screen in the team's meeting room Friday — “larger than life," as coach Sean McDermott put it — for the first time since the safety collapsed and had to be resuscitated on the field. </p><p>What sent everyone’s emotions over the top was hearing Hamlin, his mouth and throat still raw shortly after having a breathing tube removed, softly say: “ <a href="https://twitter.com/buffalobills/status/1611383102013857792?s=46&amp;t=DLkzmw_N7MIb5HHvuuu6hQ">Love you, boys</a>.”</p><p>“Amazing. Touching. To see Damar, number one, through my own eyes, I know it’s something I’ve been looking forward to, kind of needing to see,” McDermott said. “And to see the players’ reaction. They stood up right away and clapped for him and yelled some things at him. It was a pretty cool exchange.”</p><p>Four days since his heart stopped after making what appeared to be a routine tackle in a game, the 24-year-old Hamlin from his hospital room in Cincinnati and the Bills enjoyed a moment of jubilation in celebrating the next step in what his doctors have termed a remarkable recovery.</p><p>“We got our boy, man. It’s all that matters,” left tackle Dion Dawkins said. </p><p>“To see the boy’s face, to see him smile and to see him go like this in the camera,” Dawkins said, flexing his muscles to mimic Hamlin, “it was everything. And then to hear him talk, it was literally everything. That’s what we needed.”</p><p>Hamlin is now breathing and talking on his own, and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/buffalo-bills-damar-hamlin-updates-c086e472b10b4e79cd24502bcbf2e09b">traded in the writing pad</a> he had been using to communicate. Though there is no timetable for his release, Hamlin’s doctors said Thursday that both breathing on his own and showing continued signs of improvement are the final steps for him to be discharged from the University of Cincinnati Medical Center.</p><p>Hamlin spent his first two days in the hospital under sedation. Upon being awakened on Wednesday evening, Hamlin was able to follow commands and grip people’s hands. The breathing tube was removed, the team said Friday, and Hamlin's “neurologic function remains intact.” </p><p>The team did not say whether Hamlin’s status remains critical or whether he’s been moved from intensive care.</p><p>In what was an expected formality, the Bills placed Hamlin on the season-ending injured reserve list and activated rookie cornerback Christian Benford from IR. Benford has been sidelined since sustaining an oblique injury on Thanksgiving Day.</p><p>“The hair on the back of my neck stood up when he said, 'I love you boys,’” said general manager Brandon Beane, who returned to Buffalo on Thursday after spending the three days at Hamlin’s bedside along with the player’s family.</p><p>The turning point in Hamlin’s recovery, for Beane, anyway, came Thursday morning when the two exchanged hugs.</p><p>“Just to be able to hug him and the grip strength that he had,” Beane said, before recalling what he told Hamlin’s father, Mario. “I told him, I’m not a crier, but man it was emotional and a lot of grown men in there crying yesterday. Something I’ll never forget.”</p><p>The reaction from around the NFL on Friday was just as heart-warming.</p><p>“Awesome. It’s probably uplifting for the entire league,” said New York Giants coach Brian Daboll, who spent the previous four seasons as the Bills offensive coordinator. “It gives you a boost because you’re praying so hard for the young man."</p><p>The NFL announced plans to show support for Hamlin during all Week 18 games, including a pregame moment of support, painting Hamlin’s No. 3 on the 30-yard line and pregame shirts with “Love for Damar 3.” The Bills will also wear “3” jersey patches.</p><p>New York Jets rookie cornerback Sauce Gardner was already planning to wear Hamlin’s No. 3 jersey during warmups before the team’s game at Miami on Sunday.</p><p>“What a warrior. He’s so strong, a fighter for sure,” Gardner said. “I was just so happy he was able to come back to the world.” </p><p>Interacting with Hamlin gave the Bills (12-3) some encouragement and allowed them to turn their attention to the season-ending home game against the New England Patriots (8-8) on Sunday. </p><p>“It’s going to be a celebration of life and an ongoing life,” Beane said, looking ahead. </p><p>“It’s not only going to be a celebration of Buffalo, but the whole country, and I’m sure people internationally that have watched this situation,” he added. “It’s going to be a cool deal, and the only thing better is if Damar was out there by then. I don’t know if that would happen, but anyway, we’re excited for Sunday.”</p><p>The sight of Hamlin collapsing, which was broadcast to a North American TV audience on ESPN’s “Monday Night Football,” has led to an outpouring of support from fans and players from across the league. Fans, team owners and players — including Tom Brady and Russell Wilson — have made donations to Hamlin’s Chasing M’s Foundation, which had raised just short of $8 million by Friday afternoon.</p><p>___</p><p>AP Pro Football Writer Dennis Waszak Jr. and AP Sports Writer Tom Canavan contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL </p>]]></description>

Ukrainian and Western officials have scorned the truce as a ploy.</p><p>No explosions were heard in the capital. And reports of sporadic fighting elsewhere in Ukraine could not immediately by confirmed. Clashes there could take hours to become public.</p><p>Kyiv residents ventured out into a light dusting of snow to buy gifts, cakes and groceries for Christmas Eve family celebrations, hours after the cease-fire was to have started.</p><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday ordered his forces in Ukraine to observe a unilateral, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kyiv-russia-ukraine-war-government-7a4df498707bb047d2a322005c861fd0">36-hour cease-fire</a>. Kyiv officials dismissed the move but didn’t clarify whether Ukrainian troops would follow suit.</p><p>The Russian-declared truce in <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine">the nearly 11-month war</a> began at noon Friday and was to continue through midnight Saturday Moscow time (0900 GMT Friday to 2100 GMT Saturday; 4 a.m. EST Friday to 4 p.m. EST Saturday).</p><p>Air-raid sirens sounded in Kyiv about 40 minutes after the Russian cease-fire was to come into effect. The widely used “Alerts in Ukraine” app, which includes information from emergency services, showed sirens blaring across the country.</p><div id="afs:Card:521103274690" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="650d6c7930c80e61763a672d05757da8">Hub peek embed (Russia-Ukraine) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Russia's Defense Ministry alleged that Ukrainian forces continued to shell its positions, and said its forces returned fire to suppress the attacks. But it wasn’t clear from the statement whether the attacks and return of fire took place before or after the cease-fire took effect.</p><p>The ministry's spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, reported multiple Ukrainian attacks in the eastern Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions. It was not possible to verify the claims.</p><p>United Nations staffers on the ground in Ukraine “have not seen reports of intense of major fighting,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. But he cautioned that “they’re not everywhere.” </p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/kyiv-russia-ukraine-war-government-7a4df498707bb047d2a322005c861fd0">Putin’s announcement Thursday</a> that the Kremlin’s troops would stop fighting along the more than 1,000-kilometer (680-mile) front line and elsewhere was unexpected. It came after the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, proposed a cease-fire for the Christmas holiday. The Orthodox Church, which uses the Julian calendar, celebrates Christmas on Jan. 7.</p><p>But Ukrainian and Western officials portrayed the announcement as an attempt by Putin to grab the moral high ground, while possibly seeking to snatch the battlefield initiative and rob the Ukrainians of momentum amid their counteroffensive of recent months.</p><p>“Now they want to use Christmas as a cover to stop the advance of our guys in the (eastern) Donbas (region) for a while and bring equipment, ammunition and mobilized people closer to our positions,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said late Thursday.</p><p>He didn't, however, state outright that Kyiv would ignore Putin’s request.</p><p>In a Christmas Eve message to the nation, Zelenskyy called it "a holiday of harmony and family unity. And together we are all a big Ukrainian family. </p><p>“No matter where we are now — at home, at work, in a trench, on the road, in Ukraine or abroad — our family is united as never before. ... United in its belief in a single victory.”</p><p>U.S. President Joe Biden has also expressed wariness about the Russian cease-fire, saying it was “interesting” that Putin was ready to bomb hospitals, nurseries and churches in recent weeks on Christmas and New Year’s.</p><p>“I think (Putin) is trying to find some oxygen,” Biden said.</p><p>U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said Washington had “little faith in the intentions behind this announcement,” adding that Kremlin officials ”have given us no reason to take anything that they offer at face value.”</p><p>The Institute for the Study of War agreed the truce could be a ruse allowing Russia to regroup.</p><p>“Such a pause would disproportionately benefit Russian troops and begin to deprive Ukraine of the initiative,” the think tank said late Thursday. "Putin cannot reasonably expect Ukraine to meet the terms of this suddenly declared cease-fire, and may have called for the cease-fire to frame Ukraine as unaccommodating and unwilling to take the necessary steps toward negotiations.”</p><p>And Anna Borshchevskaya, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute, said that whether or not the cease-fire holds, “I don’t take it at face value.”</p><p>“When Russia announces cease-fires, in the way Russia conducts war, there are usually ulterior motives,” she said. “Historically, what the Russian government and Russian military usually do when they announce a cease-fire is to use it as a tactical opportunity, to just take a breather or gain a little bit of space.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the U.S. reiterated its support for Kyiv on Friday with a new $3.75 billion military assistance package for Ukraine and its neighbors on NATO’s eastern flank. The latest tranche of assistance will for the first time include Bradley armored vehicles for Ukraine. </p><p>The armored carrier is used to transport troops to combat and is known as a “tank-killer” because of its anti-tank missile. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the Bradleys will be particularly useful to Ukraine in ongoing fighting in largely rural areas of eastern Ukraine. </p><p>Germany, too, plans to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-biden-politics-germany-united-states-government-1fa253e2142150fc1791f7ca4a048ffb">send armored personnel carriers</a> by the end of March.</p><p>On the streets of Kyiv, some civilians said Friday that they spoke from bitter experience in doubting Russia’s motives.</p><p>“Everybody is preparing (for an attack), because everybody remembers what happened on the new year when there were around 40 Shahed" Iranian drones, said capital resident Vasyl Kuzmenko. “But everything is possible.”</p><p>At the Vatican, Pope Francis said he was sending wishes from his heart “to the Eastern churches, both the Catholic and the Orthodox ones, that tomorrow will celebrate the birth of the Lord.” Speaking to thousands of faithful gathered in St. Peter’s Square for the Epiphany feast day, Francis said, “In a special way, I would like my wish to reach the brothers and sisters of martyred Ukraine," and prayed for peace there.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow AP’s coverage of the war at <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine">https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine</a></p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>Stocks rallied after a shaky start and closed with broad gains Friday as some mixed readings on the U.S. economy stoked hope on Wall Street that inflation may keep cooling and the Federal Reserve may ease up on its interest rate hikes.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 rose 2.3%, marking its first winning week in the last five. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.1% and the Nasdaq composite added 2.6%. Small-company stocks also rose, lifting the Russell 2000 index 2.3% higher.</p><p>Markets worldwide got an initial jolt from the U.S. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-jobs-report-jan6-2023-78943d9829087d93e9681426ca0c8ae2">jobs report</a>. On the upside for them, it showed workers’ wage gains are slowing, which could mean easing pressure on the nation’s high inflation. On the downside, it also showed hiring across the job market may still be too strong for the Fed’s liking, even after its fusillade of rate hikes last year. </p><p>Analysts warned trading may remain turbulent in the coming hours and weeks as investors keep trying to handicap whether the economy can avoid a recession. Much of the trading is based entirely on expectations for what the Fed will do with rates: High rates slow the economy by design, hoping to grind down inflation, while also threatening to cause a recession and dragging down prices for all kinds of investments.</p><div id="afs:Card:386669778972" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="1192ebd20662f914bcc908c8b6d81c90">Hub peek embed (Inflation) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Perhaps the clearest action for investors was in the bond market, where the yield on the two-year Treasury dropped to 4.28% from 4.48% just before the release of the data on the U.S. labor market. </p><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>That yield tends to track expectations for Fed action, and more investors are betting the central bank will dial down the size of its next rate hike following Friday's data.</p><p>Key for them was the reading showing wages for workers across the country rose 4.6% in December from a year earlier. It’s the smallest raise for workers since two summers ago, and it came despite economists’ expectations for an acceleration.</p><p>While weaker raises hurt workers, particularly when they’re still not keeping up with inflation, economists say they could keep the economy out of a vicious cycle where big gains in pay push employers to raise prices for their own products, leading to even higher inflation. It’s something the Federal Reserve has talked about preventing, part of the reason why it’s been hiking interest rates at economy-shaking speed. </p><p>“As long as wage gains are coasting to a sustainable altitude, the Fed might continue to throttle back its rate hikes,” said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Allspring Global Investments. </p><p>A separate report also showed that activity in U.S. services industries surprisingly contracted last month, the first time that's happened since 2020. Analysts said that's likely due in part to the rate hikes already pushed through by the Fed, and the weakness could also reduce pressure on the nation's inflation.</p><p>That report helped steady the stock market following a shaky morning and sent it ripping higher again. After opening the day with an initial pop of 1.2%, the S&amp;P 500 lost almost all of it within minutes as Wall Street struggled with how to interpret the U.S. jobs report and what it means for the Fed and rates.</p><p>The Fed has pulled its key overnight rate up to a range of 4.25% to 4.50% after it began last year at virtually zero. </p><p>With inflation showing some signs of cooling in recent months, the Fed last month stepped down the size of its rate increase to 0.50 percentage points from four straight hikes of 0.75 points. Traders are largely betting on the Fed to move to the more traditional hike of 0.25 points at its meeting next month.</p><p>Regardless of the size of rate increases the Fed elects to go with at the next couple of policymaking committee meetings, Wall Street is expecting the central bank will hit the pause button on rate hikes after March, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. </p><p>“Our belief is that they will start to cut interest rates in December 2023, even though they currently say they’re not looking to cut rates this year,” Stovall said. "The weakness in the economic data will tell them that they should and the decline in the inflation data will tell them that they can.”</p><p>Past rate hikes have already meant big pain for areas of the economy that do best when rates are low, such as housing. </p><p>In coming weeks, companies across industries will show how widespread the damage is when they report how much profit they made during the last three months of 2022. </p><p>If companies across the S&amp;P 500 report a drop in overall earnings per share, as some analysts suspect, it would be the first decline since the summer of 2020.</p><p>On Friday, retailer Costco Wholesale jumped 7.3% for one of the biggest gains in the S&amp;P 500 after it reported stronger sales for December.</p><p>The market's gains were widespread Friday, with about 95% of the stocks in the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index closing higher. Technology companies powered much of the rally. Chipmaker Nvidia rose 4.2%.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 closed 86.98 points higher at 3,895.08. The Dow added 700.53 points to finish at 33,630.61, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 264.05 points to 10,569.29. The Russell 2000 added 39.61 points to close at 1,792.80.</p><p>___</p><p>AP Business Writer Yuri Kageyama contributed.</p>]]></description>

Hextiles can be connected to each other to form a bigger collection of buttons.</p><div id="b4fff9c28e454ecb93b646a4c2d6ef33" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>“We find that actually when dogs kind of know that they’re being understood because they have the precision and specificity of the buttons, then they complain less because they’re no longer wondering whether they actually communicated what they wanted to,” said Leo Trottier, FluentPet CEO.</p><p>At CES, the company announced FluentPet Connect, a new app that notifies owners when their dog presses a button and collects data on how the buttons are used.</p><p>Fluent Pet’s starter kit comes with hextiles, a speaker and six buttons for $159.95. The app does not require a subscription.</p><div id="afs:Card:376939735184" content-id="9d127822b54184e6c4d8313368667dc0" class="hub-peek-embed">Hub peek embed (apf-technology) - Compressed layout </div><h2>A HIGH-TECH STROLLER</h2><p>Canadian startup Gluxkind's smart stroller is designed to make life easier for parents on the go.</p><p>The AI-powered stroller has a sensor that can tell when you've picked up a fussy baby, at which point it will roll in front of you while you walk without you having to touch it. </p><p>When the baby is in the stroller, you need to keep your hands on it, but the battery will help propel it, making it easier to push uphill. It stops automatically if it gets too far away from whoever is pushing it. It can also rock a baby back and forth.</p><div id="4abc154e9b8840d3b4b62a8410289aa2" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>The battery lasts for about eight hours and takes two to four hours to charge.</p><p>“I looked into the stroller market and were really surprised that we didn’t find anything that has some kind of level of automation or motorization present,” said Anne Hunger, who co-founded the company with husband Kevin Huang after their daughter was born in 2020.</p><p>The company is currently taking pre-orders for the stroller and hopes to deliver them beginning in July. Prices start at $3,300.</p><h2>A CALMING PILLOW</h2><p>Need a break? Japan's Yukai Engineering says its robotic fufuly pillow can help users relax by mimicking the rhythm of breathing.</p><p>The soft, fluffy pillow gently expands and contracts, vibrating as you hold it against your stomach. The idea is that you'll breathe more slowly and deeply as your breath starts to synch with the movement of the pillow.</p><div id="6f8f5eb4756c413481cc5282e0ce7d77" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>It was developed based on research done at the University of Tokyo.</p><p>Yukai CEO Shunsuke Aoki said the pillow can help remote workers who struggle to switch off from their jobs. </p><p>The version on display at CES is a prototype. The company is looking for partners and hopes to start producing it this year.</p><h2>ROBOT DOG</h2><p>Meet Dog-E, the excitable robodog.</p><p>Unveiled by toy maker WowWee, Dog-E has more than a million possible combinations of lights, sounds and personality traits.</p><p>Dog-E begins as a blank canvas and develops its personality as you set it up.</p><p>The app-connected toy has audio sensors to hear sounds, touch sensors on its sides and body, and a tail that you can program to display lighted icons and messages when it wags.</p><div id="4276298ae583491684a32955504857e2" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>Jessica Kalichman from WowWee says it’s a good option for those who can’t commit to owning a real pup, or perhaps for those with allergies.</p><p>“I do think for anyone that’s either not ready to have a dog yet, this is a great test to take care of it, learn to feed it, nurture it, and really have that trial run for a family,” she said.</p><p>WowWee expects to have Dog-E in stores in September. It will sell for $79. The app to control the toy’s movements does not require a subscription.</p><h2>A FOLDABLE TREADMILL</h2><p>If you want a treadmill but don't have much space, WalkingPad offers a solution — a lightweight treadmill that can be folded in two when not in use and stored against a wall or under a bed.</p><p>WalkingPad reaches speeds of 7.5 mph (12 kph). It also includes a detachable phone or tablet holder and tracks your exercises in a free app. Its creators envision it helping remote workers stay fit at home.</p><div id="61f8c9781b1b46c2a2532fc988f08bf2" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>An early version of WalkingPad went viral on TikTok as influencers added it to videos about their daily work-at-home routines. </p><p>Walking Pad creator King Smith Fitness opened its first headquarters in Dallas in December.</p><p>___</p><p>For more on CES, visit: <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/technology">https://apnews.com/hub/technology</a></p>]]></description>

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — America’s employers added a solid 223,000 jobs in December, evidence that the economy remains healthy even as the Federal Reserve is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-business-jerome-powell-government-and-politics-81b03a1a55ae8a934e2df45120912133">rapidly raising interest rates to try to slow economic growth and the pace of hiring</a>. </p><p>With companies continuing to add jobs across the economy, the unemployment rate fell from 3.6% to 3.5%, matching a 53-year low, the Labor Department said Friday. </p><p>All told, the December jobs report suggested that the labor market may be cooling in a way that could aid the Fed's fight against high inflation. Last month's gain was the smallest in two years, and it extended a hiring slowdown that began last year. And average hourly pay growth eased to its slowest pace in 16 months. That slowdown could reduce pressure on employers to raise prices to offset their higher labor costs.</p><p>Average wage growth was up 4.6% in December from 12 months earlier, compared with a recent peak of 5.6% in March. And in the past three months, job gains have averaged 247,000 — a decent pace but well below 2022's monthly average of 375,000.</p><p>“If these trends continue, we can feel more and more confident that the strength of this labor market is sustainable,” said Nick Bunker, head of economic research at the online job site Indeed’s Hiring Lab. “The outlook for next year is uncertain, but many signs point toward a soft landing,” rather than a feared recession. </p><div id="afs:Card:386669778972" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="78943d9829087d93e9681426ca0c8ae2">Hub peek embed (Inflation) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>Traders on Wall Street <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-business-united-states-government-federal-reserve-system-financial-markets-1192ebd20662f914bcc908c8b6d81c90?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=TopNews&amp;utm_campaign=position_10">appeared encouraged by the jobs report’s suggestion of milder pay growth.</a> Stock prices rose sharply.</p><p>At the same time, December's hiring figures don't necessarily make the Fed's path forward any clearer. The pace of job gains is still strong enough to keep lowering the unemployment rate, which, in turn, could keep pay growth high. Lisa Cook, a member of the Fed's Board of Governors, said in a speech Friday that “inflation is far too high” and “of great concern,” though she also noted that wage growth “has indeed started to decelerate."</p><p>Other recent data also point to a cooling economy: A measure of business activity in services, including finance, restaurants and transportation, contracted in December for the first time since 2020. A similar measure for manufacturing also shrank last month. </p><p>And a near-doubling of mortgage rates this year has sent <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-pandemics-los-angeles-national-association-of-realtors-bda6fcab8b5abc040b78327b9dfced77">home sales tumbling for 10 straight months</a>. </p><p>Last month’s job gains capped a second straight year of robust hiring during which the nation regained all 22 million jobs it lost to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet the rapid hiring and the hefty pay raises that accompanied it likely contributed to a spike in prices that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-ap-news-alert-f3b7b00f232b7c3d6ea9bf2f605c5d9d">catapulted inflation to its highest level in 40 years</a>. </p><p>The picture for 2023 is much cloudier. Many economists foresee a recession in the second half of the year, a consequence of the Fed’s succession of sharp rate hikes. The central bank’s officials have projected that those increases will cause the unemployment rate to reach 4.6% by year’s end. </p><p>Though the Fed’s higher rates have begun to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-news-alert-business-government-and-politics-1c39bb8c1be2ede52fd9a00287428628">cool inflation from its summertime peak</a>, they've also made mortgages, auto loans and other consumer and business borrowing more expensive.</p><p>For now at least, the pace of hiring is showing surprising resilience in the face of higher interest rates across the economy. One recent beneficiary is Ethan Edwards of Oklahoma City, who accepted a job offer last month after having looked around for nearly a year.</p><p>Edwards, 41, had taken his time because he was picky: He already had a job in local broadcasting, where he worked in marketing. But he wanted to find a position in a new industry in which he could work from home while avoiding a pay cut. </p><p>The strong job market eventually delivered. A recruiting firm, Aquent, connected Edwards to a digital marketing company, where he now leads strategic planning.</p><p>“So far," he said, “every step of the way has been awesome.”</p><p>Among industries, the largest job gains last month were in health care, which added 74,000. Leisure and hospitality, a category includes restaurants, hotels, and entertainment, gained nearly as much: 67,000. </p><p>Retailers added 9,000, transportation and warehousing companies nearly 5,000. Construction companies added 28,000 — a surprisingly large gain considering that higher borrowing rates are dragging down <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-pandemics-los-angeles-national-association-of-realtors-bda6fcab8b5abc040b78327b9dfced77">residential</a> and commercial real estate.</p><p>Many of those jobs were part-time positions. That trend suggests that as inflation began to accelerate, some people took on second jobs to help keep up with rising costs. </p><p>Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, noted that the December jobs report showed that roughly 80% of people who found jobs last month took part-time work, which typically pays less than full-time jobs. That is likely one reason why wage growth has been slowing.</p><p>President Joe Biden suggested Friday that the continuing job gains were, in part, a reflection of his policies, in which the government supplied vast aid during the pandemic to boost hiring and then added spending on infrastructure, computer chips, manufacturing and other areas to support business investment.</p><p>“It’s a good time to be a worker in America,” Biden said in a statement. “We still have work to do to bring down inflation.” </p><p>Jared Bernstein, a top economic adviser to Biden, said the administration is still hoping for growth in inflation-adjusted wages.</p><p>“What’s important to us is that families have the buying power through their paychecks to get ahead,” Bernstein said</p><p>Some companies, notably restaurants and hotels, are still scrambling to regain jobs lost to the pandemic. Among them is HMSHost, which operates 990 airport restaurants in North America under 350 different brands. The company is looking to hire 100 workers to help staff new restaurants that will open in the coming weeks. </p><p>Laura E. FitzRandolph, the chief human resources officer, said the company expects demand for travel to remain strong in 2023. </p><p>“We’re not slowing down in our hiring efforts or our business at all,” she said.</p><p>HMSHost hired roughly 23,000 people last year as the company desperately tried to staff up after laying off 90% of their workers during COVID-19 shutdowns. FitzRandolph said many job applicants had failed to show up for interviews. But in recent months, the company is seeing more people apply for openings, and those applicants are more likely to appear for interviews. </p><p>“It's becoming somewhat easier to find people to work in the restaurant industry," she said.</p><p>In June, year-over-year inflation had <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-ap-news-alert-f3b7b00f232b7c3d6ea9bf2f605c5d9d">reached 9.1%</a>, the highest level in 40 years, before slowing to 7.1% in November. Last year, in an aggressive drive to reduce inflation back toward its 2% goal, the Fed raised its benchmark rate seven times.</p><p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-business-prices-jerome-powell-government-and-politics-9e7fed8f82ffbe9af205ec969e6277af">emphasized in recent remarks</a> that consistently strong job growth, which can force employers to raise pay to find and keep workers, can perpetuate inflation: Companies often raise prices to pass on their higher labor costs to their customers. And higher pay typically fuels more consumer spending, which can keep inflation elevated.</p><p>For that reason, Powell and other Fed officials have signaled their belief that to tame inflation, unemployment will have to rise from its current low level. </p><p>Technology companies have been laying off workers for months, with some, including Amazon, saying that they had hired too many people during the pandemic. Amazon <a href="https://apnews.com/article/twitter-inc-technology-business-layoffs-dfeced152095186df3e6d0937bfccceb">has boosted its layoffs to 18,000</a> from an earlier announcement of 10,000. Cloud software provider Salesforce <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-san-francisco-marc-benioff-bbb2f3a09eafdfc7cda54a3b87e538ad">says it will cut 10% of its workers</a>. And Facebook’s parent company Meta says it will shed 11,000. </p><p>Yet outside of high tech, smaller companies, in particular, are still hiring. According to the payroll processor ADP, companies with more than 500 employees cut jobs in December, while businesses below that threshold added many more workers. And an analysis by investment bank Jefferies showed that small companies were posting a historically high proportion of job openings. </p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press Writer Josh Boak contributed to this report. </p>]]></description>

The running shootouts also killed one Culiacan policeman, and wounded 17 police officers and 35 military personnel.</p><p>The cartel then opened fire on the military aircraft, forcing two of them down with “a significant number of impacts” in each of the two aircraft, Sandoval said. The gang then sent hordes of gunmen to attack fixed-wing aircraft, both military and civilian, at the city’s international airport.</p><p>One civilian airliner was hit. The gunmen also shot up airport buildings in a bid to prevent authorities from flying the captured cartel boss out of the city. But, Sandoval said, authorities anticipating the resistance had loaded Ovidio Guzman onto a military helicopter to fly him back to Mexico City.</p><div id="afs:Card:678853846262" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="d74ba460138c067ca538c862e3f0a5b0">Hub peek embed (apf-politics) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The Mexican administration bagged the high-profile cartel figure days before hosting U.S. President Joe Biden.</p><p>Samuel González, who founded Mexico’s special prosecutor’s office for organized crime in the 1990s, said Guzmán’s capture was a “gift” ahead of Biden’s visit. The Mexican government “is working to have a calm visit,” he said.</p><p>Juan Carlos Ayala, a Culiacan resident and Sinaloa University professor who studies the sociology of drug trafficking, said Ovidio Guzmán had been an obvious target for years.</p><p>“Ovidio’s fate had been decided. Moreover, he was identified as the biggest trafficker of fentanyl and the most visible Chapos leader.”</p><p>Ayala said the atmosphere was calmer Friday, “but there are still a lot of burned-out vehicles blocking the streets.”</p><div id="c4a19740044f4543bb30cda81f34b1e1" class="media-placeholder"></div><p>The scope of Thursday’s violence was such that Sinaloa Gov. Ruben Rocha said cartel gunmen showed up at local hospitals, trying to abduct doctors and take them away to treat wounded fighters. Rocha said that gunmen would be treated if they showed up at hospitals, but that gunmen shouldn’t try to abduct medical personnel.</p><p>“It got to the point that at one moment the doctors were saying, ‘We’re getting out of here’,” recalled Rocha, saying police reinforced security and convinced the doctors to stay.</p><p>Culiacan residents posted video on social media showing convoys of gunmen in pickup trucks and SUVs rolling down boulevards in the city on Thursday. At least one convoy included a flatbed truck with a mounted gun in the back.</p><p>Unlike a failed 2019 attempt to arrest Ovidio Guzman — the government said it had to release him to avoid further bloodshed — this time around there were fewer civilian casualties, just one 14-year-old boy shot but expected to survive.</p><p>One difference was that the September 2019 raid was in the city of Culiacan itself around midday, while Thursday's raid was around dawn in a more sparsely populated area to the north. </p><p>Víctor Medrano, director of the Culiacan Chamber of Commerce, said that in 2019 “everything happened in broad daylight, and we were caught on the street or at work.”</p><p>While most people stayed in their homes Thursday, by Friday people were starting to go back out on the streets, Medrano said. “There is still some fear ... but as they day goes on, there are greater number of people out,” he said. </p><p>But Sergio Alvarez, head of another local business chamber, said that in some sense the effects of Thursday's violence were greater. “There were blockades across the whole city."</p><p>Ismael Bojórquez, director of the crusading local newspaper Ríodoce, said the cartel appears to have only grown stronger since 2019, when 13 people were killed in the failed raid.</p><p>“They (cartels) have taken advantage of these four years to organize themselves, arm themselves, strengthen their structures, their finances,” he said. “I believe there are more weapons than three years ago. All of organized crime’s armies have strengthened, not just the Chapitos, and this is the price that society is paying for this strategy of the federal government.”</p><p>Thursday's violence was unusual in that it also targeted and forced the closure of Culiacan’s airport, where one military plane and a civilian airliner were hit by bullets. </p><p>The commercial flight waited for its chance to take off as two large military planes landed with troops.</p><p>When the airliner was finally preparing to accelerate, passengers heard gunshots in the distance. Within 15 seconds the sound was suddenly more intense and much closer, and passengers threw themselves to the floor, some said.</p><p>They said they did not know the plane had been hit by gunfire until a flight attendant told them. No one was injured, but the plane hastily retreated to the terminal.</p><p>Guzmán was indicted by the United States on drug trafficking charges in 2018. According to both governments, he had assumed a growing role among his brothers in carrying on their father’s business, along with long- time cartel boss Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada. </p><p>Foreign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard confirmed that the government had received a request in 2019 from the United States for Guzmán’s arrest for purposes of extradition. He said that request would have to be updated and processed, but he added that first an open case in Mexico awaits Guzmán.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Fabiola Sánchez and Christopher Sherman contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

The Federal Trade Commission is proposing a new rule that would prevent employers from imposing noncompete clauses on their workers. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)</p></figcaption></figure>    <p>The Federal Trade Commission proposed a rule Thursday that would ban U.S. employers from imposing noncompete clauses on workers, a sweeping measure that could make it easier for people to switch jobs and deepen competition for labor across a wide range of industries.</p><p>The proposed <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/federal-register-notices/non-compete-clause-rulemaking">rule</a> would prevent employers from imposing contract clauses that prohibit their employees from joining a competitor, typically for a period of time, after they leave the company. </p><p>Advocates of the new rule argue that noncompete agreements contribute to wage stagnation because one of the most effective ways to secure higher pay is switching companies. They argue that the clauses have become so commonplace that they have swept up even low-wage workers. </p><p>Opponents argue that by facilitating retention, noncompete clauses have encouraged companies to promote workers and invest in training, especially in a tight labor market. The public has 60 days to submit commentary on the rule before it takes effect. </p><p>During a Cabinet meeting, President Joe Biden called the FTC action “a huge step forward in banning non-compete agreements that are designed simply to lower people’s wages.”</p><p>"These agreements block millions of retail workers, construction workers and other working folks from taking better jobs and getting better pay and benefits in the same field,” Biden said.</p><div id="afs:Card:522963396423" class="hub-peek-embed" content-id="9fb699837e8bf8ecd9c70dcf27699dcf">Hub peek embed (apf-technology) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="taboola_readmore" data="autoembed"></div><p>The FTC has moved aggressively to curb the power of major corporations under <a href="https://apnews.com/article/frances-haugen-lina-khan-elizabeth-holmes-37d14570b9221962010171c0844e534a">Chair Lina Khan</a>, a legal scholar and Washington outsider whose appointment by Biden signaled a tough antitrust stance. </p><p>The agency estimates that the new rule could boost wages by nearly $300 billion a year and expand career opportunities for about 30 million Americans.</p><p>“Noncompetes block workers from freely switching jobs, depriving them of higher wages and better working conditions, and depriving businesses of a talent pool that they need to build and expand,” Khan said in a prepared statement.</p><p>The FTC’s proposal comes amid <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-jobs-and-careers-federal-reserve-system-005ac62672d87fb9f81bd9b97caecfc5">an already competitive job market,</a> particularly in industries that suffered mass layoffs during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and have since struggled to recall their workers. Many workers remain on the sidelines, holding out for better pay, coping with lingering childcare or health issues, or opting for early retirement. </p><p>"There is a potential that it will contribute to the ‘great resignation' that everyone is talking about to some degree, but employers are simply losing one of the tools in their toolbox and there are other ways to retain top talent," said Vanessa Matsis-McCready, associate general counsel and director of human resources for Engage PEO, which provides HR services for small- and medium-sized companies. "You will see a lot of business trying to retain top talent via raises or other fringe benefits.” </p><p>Employers nationwide are still hiring and layoffs are historically low, despite <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-san-francisco-marc-benioff-bbb2f3a09eafdfc7cda54a3b87e538ad">high-profile job cut announcements</a> from companies such as software provider Salesforce, Facebook’s parent company Meta, and Amazon. The government is expected to announce Friday that employers added a solid 200,000 jobs last month, and that unemployment remained 3.7%, near a half-century low.</p><p>A 2019 analysis by the liberal Economic Policy Institute estimated that 36 million to 60 million workers could be subject to noncompete agreements, which the group said companies have increasingly adopted in recent years. </p><p>While such agreements are most common among higher-paid workers, the study found that a significant number of low-wage workers were subjected to them. The study found that more than a quarter of responding establishments where the average wage is less than $13 an hour use noncompetes for all their workers.</p><p>On Wednesday, for example, the FTC <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/01/ftc-cracks-down-companies-impose-harmful-noncompete-restrictions-thousands-workers?ftag=YHFa5b931b">took action</a> against three companies for unlawfully imposing noncompete clauses against workers, including low-wage security guards who were threatened with a $100,000 fine if they violated the agreement. </p><p>The EPI study found that many companies still impose noncompete clauses in several states that already ban or restrict them, including in California, where the practice has been prohibited for a century. </p><p>The proposed FTC rule would require companies to scrap existing noncompete causes and actively inform workers that they are no longer in effect, as well as prohibiting the imposition of new ones. </p><p>The proposal is based on a preliminary finding that noncompete clauses quash competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. It would not generally apply to other types of employment restrictions, like non-disclosure agreements. </p><p>But Emily Dickens, chief of staff and head of public affairs for the Society for Human Resource Management, said the proposed FTC rule is overly broad and could potentially harm businesses that depend on them to thrive. She cited very small, emerging industries where crucial know-how cannot be safeguarded through non-disclosure agreements alone. </p><p>Dickens said SHRM, a group of more than 300,000 human resources professionals and executives around the world, will encourage its members to present specific situations that could justify noncompete clauses during the FTC's commentary period. </p><p>Although "there are jobs where it makes no sense to have noncompete," Dickens said, “this kind of blanket ban is going to stifle innovation.” </p><p>While defenders of non-compete clauses argue they help start-ups and small business retain talent, opponents say they hinder recruitment at those same entities. </p><p>The Economic Innovation Group, a Washington-based public policy research group, applauded the rule and called on Congress to pass proposed legislation that would impose a similar ban with more permanency. </p><p>“Restricting the use of non-compete agreements is fundamentally good policy that will boost wages, improve workforce mobility, and encourage entrepreneurship and innovation throughout the economy,” said John Lettieri, EIG's president and CEO. </p><p>—-</p><p>Associated Press writers Chris Rugaber and Nancy Benac in Washington contributed to this report.</p><p>__</p><p>This story was first published on January 5, 2023.

            <title><![CDATA[The Year of the Slap: Pop culture moments in 2022]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Taylor Swift was up. Elon Musk was in, out, in and maybe out again. Tom Cruise was back. BTS stepped aside, and so did Serena Williams, and Tom Brady too — oops, scratch that.</p><p>But the slap? <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-oscars-show-9a69424884de11649b68a12a284353a1">The slap</a> was everywhere.</p><p>Ok, so maybe it wasn’t on the level of a moon landing, or selection of a pope. But henceforth all you need say is “the slap” and people will know what you mean — that moment Will Smith smacked Chris Rock at the Oscars and a global audience said, “Wait, did that happen?" <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-oscars-top-moments-f26255e20fd810a3fe0d6722eb9df5ac">Even in the room itself</a> — maybe especially in the room itself — there was a sense everyone had imagined it, which helps explain why things went on as normal, for a bit.</p><p>The pandemic was over, phew! Well, of course it wasn’t. But live entertainment pushed forward in 2022, with mask mandates dropping and people rushing to buy things like, oh, Taylor Swift tickets!</p><p>We’ll take any segue to mention Swift, who already had a big year in 2021, but just got bigger — heck, she <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-music-taylor-swift-930a204fbbfccea45f6012f0da4feef6">broke Billboard records</a> and then she <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-music-taylor-swift-af5d58d2a8c6def368ded1bd2ddd8a6f">broke Ticketmaster</a>. (No word if she got her scarf back).</p><p>It was a year of celebrity #MeToo cases like <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/harvey-weinstein">Harvey Weinstein</a> (again), <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/r-kelly">R. Kelly</a> (again), <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-anthony-rapp-manhattan-kevin-spacey-910b90edbb92f00c7461809b13b8e782">Kevin Spacey</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-movies-lawsuits-paul-haggis-c12bd93280bc86eff399fcbf6cbf81e7">Paul Haggis</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/danny-masterson-mistrial-rape-trial-162a670d6068f05462825a96e4193fd8">Danny Masterson</a>. And the <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/johnny-depp">Johnny Depp-Amber Heard</a> defamation trial, its every excruciating turn captured on TV.</p><p>On the big screen, there were big comebacks. Mourning its dearly missed star, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/race-and-ethnicity-ap-top-news-ca-state-wire-entertainment-dc-wire-8aaf07cd19ae3f2135bcc31b00917be0">Chadwick Boseman</a>, “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” was a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/black-panther-wakanda-forever-box-office-42b8e6de23ec93da1369a9942027f4e4">box office triumph</a>. James Cameron’s “Avatar” made a splashy December return.</p><p>Then there was Cruise, turning 60 in ’22 just like the Rolling Stones, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/cannes-film-festival-tom-cruise-top-gun-224738d477b69b499ae901b09ad7f40d">swooping into Cannes</a> with his <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-movies-north-america-steven-spielberg-bb005f1efd6a5de2ef40acd4c588214e">most successful movie</a> and showing, like those still-touring rockers, that when they tell you “The end is inevitable,” as they do in “Top Gun: Maverick,” you can always reply: “Maybe so, sir, but not today.”</p><p>Will audiences one day find Cruise – or the Stones, for that matter – too wrinkled and past the sell-by date? Maybe so, but not this year.</p><p>Our annual, totally selective journey through a year in pop culture:</p><p>JANUARY</p><p>It’s GOLDEN GLOBES time. But is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/golden-globe-awards-7807652153518b2df70e636dd22654c2">a Globes with no telecast</a>, boozy celebs or red carpet a Globes at all? The embattled Hollywood Foreign Press Association, reeling from <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-02-21/hfpa-golden-globes-2021-who-are-the-members">stunning failures over diversity</a>, holds a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/golden-globe-awards-7807652153518b2df70e636dd22654c2">private event</a> and plans a comeback next year. Hey, remember the original wardrobe malfunction? Well, JANET JACKSON says she and JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/janet-jackson-breaks-silence-on-justin-timberlake-super-bowl/">have moved on</a>, and so should we. The New York Times <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-york-times-buys-wordle-c1e77bd65f21464f98f8cf4246457d6b">buys Wordle,</a> and we’re all thinking in five-letter words (though W-O-R-D-L-E is six, just saying.) Meanwhile, it’s a month of loss, heading off a year of loss: pioneering Black actor, director and activist <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sidney-poitier-dead-214e66b7e52909bdc64465e9ff4a1339">SIDNEY POITIER dies</a> at 94.</p><p>FEBRUARY</p><p>What would a year in pop culture be without BRITNEY? Just months after her <a href="https://apnews.com/article/britney-spears-conservatorship-5dbba74b8be90cd233830f2cb001d74c">liberation from her restrictive conservatorship</a>, Spears is reported to have signed <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2022/02/22/britney-spears-15-million-book-deal-shows-why-success-is-the-best-revenge/?sh=2526da8656ba">a mammoth book deal</a>, but at year's end we're still waiting for news. RIHANNA is pregnant! TOM BRADY retires! (Stay tuned, on that one.) TAYLOR watch: JAKE GYLLENHAAL speaks out, saying he really <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/jake-gyllenhaal-confirms-taylor-swift-all-too-well-not-about-me-1235032891/">has nothing to do with that song. </a></p><p>MARCH</p><p>Quick, who wins Oscars this month? Well, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/coda-wins-best-picture-oscar-marking-a-streaming-first">“CODA” does,</a> a feel-good drama with a largely deaf cast, and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-best-supporting-actor-winner-4baeddf081e70ca0db414c4a50c4fbe7">TROY KOTSUR becomes the first deaf male actor</a> to win an acting Oscar. Alas, all anyone can talk about is — you know. SMITH, who <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-oscars-will-smith-chris-rock-confrontation-f90b206e1032b9889c28c3a3deee59ce">wins the best actor award</a> not long after slapping Rock over a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, won’t truly address the issue until the end of the year, so keep reading. KARDASHIAN watch: <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-arts-and-entertainment-los-angeles-kanye-west-62a88772e6a84f28bc543301e04892dc">Kim K is declared legally single again</a> in her ongoing divorce with YE, the rapper formerly known as KANYE WEST. And BRADY, retired for 40 days, says, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/super-bowl-tampa-bay-buccaneers-tom-brady-nfl-sports-f6d646a9109b591183836fbf593c0f2b">“Never mind!”</a></p><p>APRIL</p><p>It’s GRAMMY time, and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/grammy-awards-entertainment-movies-hats-new-orleans-a37040d9aca4d518cfeb8eb6259a9504">JON BATISTE wins big</a>, taking five statuettes. The musician's huge year will later include performing at the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-jill-united-states-macron-state-dinners-73f5a0d51b4058c7b96ec1e43c59a3e1">first state dinner</a> of the Biden administration, for French President Emmanuel Macron. The next day <a href="https://apnews.com/article/louisiana-new-orleans-john-bel-edwards-macron-energy-policy-a7bfcf4982d3975a6bc01103406e96e0">Macron will meet with MUSK</a> (thanks for the segue, Monsieur le President) who <a href="https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-twitter-takeover-2d0eb4e0511fe0e296fd6974a851a252">begins his acquisition of TWITTER</a> this month, leading to untold — and still unfolding — changes at the social media giant.</p><p>MAY</p><p>So imagine you’re sipping <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-met-gala-inside-cocktail-reception-a5342e7c339aded184a07f44115b2016">cocktails at the MET GALA</a> and a musician comes sauntering through, playing the melodica — of course it’s BATISTE, because the Met Gala’s that kind of crazy party. The biggest splash of the night, though, is KARDASHIAN, on the arm of boyfriend PETE DAVIDSON, wearing <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-met-gala-live-updates-084f719d371e251fc545fd1ad49300d3">the same sequined, skin tight gown MARILYN MONROE wore</a> to sing “Happy Birthday” to JFK in 1962. In movies, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/cannes-film-festival-tom-cruise-top-gun-224738d477b69b499ae901b09ad7f40d">“Top Gun: Maverick” opens, the highest-grossing domestic debut in CRUISE’S career</a>, and his first to surpass $100 million on opening weekend. HARRY STYLES fans rejoice! His album, “Harry’s House,” is here.</p><p>JUNE</p><p>Stunning news for the global fanbase of BTS as the K-pop <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-government-and-politics-south-korea-1319921a0072141d7729c9d5dc7e689e">supergroup announces it’s taking a break</a> to focus on members’ solo projects. On the legal front, a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/johnny-depp-amber-heard-trial-jury-deliberations-2a484944ecfa8947f9f59b44c14bae39">Virginia jury hands DEPP a victory</a> in his very messy libel case over allegations of domestic abuse, finding that former wife HEARD defamed him in a 2018 op-ed. On a happier note, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/britney-spears-entertainment-kevin-federline-california-jason-alexander-fb5181ab8aa369229f50fbd01b579c29">Britney gets married….</a></p><p>JULY</p><p>Only one wedding, Britney? BENNIFER has two! Maybe what happens in Vegas usually stays in Vegas, but not when you have 227 million followers on Instagram. With a winking reference to being a “Sadie” (married lady) JENNIFER LOPEZ directs fans to her newsletter where she shares pics of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-get-marriage-license-nevada-724bb19ab5273d87410f107b1b88cdcd">her quickie wedding to BEN AFFLECK</a>. “Love is beautiful,” she writes. “And it turns out love is patient.” Speaking of patience, fans of BEYONCÉ are rewarded for theirs with the release of her long-awaited <a href="https://apnews.com/article/megan-thee-stallion-b80de408e26994794595874c1d0680c5">“Renaissance,”</a> her first solo album in six years.</p><p>AUGUST</p><p>So, we were saying ... <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-music-celebrity-georgia-b4214ffd2ddc814668a1f95e12ad46eb">Bennifer’s second wedding,</a> on Affleck’s compound in Georgia, is bigger and fancier. One wedding, one split: KARDASHIAN and DAVIDSON are no longer. In other summer news, the world remembers PRINCESS DIANA, whose shocking death <a href="https://apnews.com/article/princess-diana-death-august-1997-coverage-f95a64d93949bf73a5644a91627d204b">happened 25 years ago</a>, and whose life is being rehashed for a new generation in the current season of “The Crown." Only days after the anniversary, that same Netflix series will pause production as a mark of respect for QUEEN ELIZABETH II as Britain — and the world — mourn the beloved monarch, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/That%20same%20Netflix%20series%20will%20pause%20production%20briefly%20in%20early%20September%20as%20a%20mark%20of%20respect%20for%20Queen%20Elizabeth%20II%20as%20Britain%20%E2%80%94%20and%20the%20world%20%E2%80%94%20mourn%20the%20beloved%20monarch,%20who%20dies%20at%20age%2096%20after%2070%20years%20on%20the%20throne.">who dies at age 96</a> after more than 70 years on the throne. </p><p>SEPTEMBER</p><p>Mounting political intrigue in Europe, and by that we mean, did spit fly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/harry-styles-venice-film-festival-olivia-wilde--54b69289f86e9034245126dd69981c4a">at the Venice premiere of “Don’t Worry Darling”?</a> Either way the movie, directed by OLIVIA WILDE and starring her boyfriend (alleged spitter STYLES), is saddled – or blessed? – with more than its share of extracurricular drama. At the EMMYS, behold <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-emmys-highlights-9a14e30b45e94f3a6935e56b05157312">SHERYL LEE RALPH, who wins for “Abbott Elementary”</a> and schools the crowd on the power of dreams and self-belief. “This is what believing looks like,” she says. You know what else believing looks like?

But before the month worms away from us, let’s cede it to SWIFT for dropping her new album, “Midnights” (Spotify's most-streamed album in a single day), then adding <a href="https://apnews.com/article/taylor-swift-midnights-music-video-5c11d7d0e9cbb17ccc9a120c4a3882f6">seven bonus tracks</a>, then becoming the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-music-taylor-swift-930a204fbbfccea45f6012f0da4feef6">first artist to occupy all top 10 slots on the Billboard Hot 100 chart</a>.
