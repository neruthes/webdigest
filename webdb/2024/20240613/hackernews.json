Arjun and Zara here - cofounders of Overwatch (\u003ca href=\"https://www.overwatchdata.ai\"\u003ehttps://www.overwatchdata.ai\u003c/a\u003e), a platform to automate OSINT and threat intel, turning it into actionable insights.  Check out our clickthrough demo here: \u003ca href=\"https://app.storylane.io/share/qyayvtamapis\"\u003ehttps://app.storylane.io/share/qyayvtamapis\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cp\u003eOverwatch began when we were working with risk and threat intel teams at Google, Stripe, and government. We experienced the immense challenge every fraud and cyber threat analyst faces: manually parsing through an ocean of data to find valuable insights and filter out the noise. This included using many of the feeds and tools out there that were often very expensive, noisy, keyword-based, and lacked accurate entity extraction or advanced query features.\u003cp\u003eMost threat intelligence tools utilize thousands of keywords and teams of analysts to manually sift through torrents of alerts. These alerts are usually individual posts on various platforms across news, social media, deep and dark web sources that have some matching keyword. This is full of false positives, requiring many hours to wade through to figure out what intel matters most to our users, why, and what they can do next.\u003cp\u003eOverwatch uses an alternative approach by layering AI agents and NLP techniques, including a combination of multifarious datasets, cluster analysis, topic modeling, Retrieval Augmented Language Models (RALM) and domain knowledgeable agents.\u003cp\u003eThis allows us to (1) Filter through OSINT in real time to identify events and narratives that matter to our users, and write reports on what they could do about it; (2) Identify dark web and deep web threats, fraud methods, new tactics, and compromised accounts, stolen checks, and credentials affecting our users or their peers; (3) Send an alert any time one a 3rd party supplier or parts of the tech stack are impacted by a widely exploited vulnerability, ransomware attack, or breach; and (4) Track malware and ransomware groups that are actively targeting your industry including Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).\u003cp\u003eOur intelligence is actionable because the alert comes with the context and important details that an analyst needs to make an informed decision. Being AI-native, we also have a range of chat and data visualization features to effectively function as an intel co-pilot or industry expert. Finally, our in-house intelligence analysts and investigators can assist threat intelligence teams with HUMINT investigations and darkweb acquisition.\u003cp\u003eOur current customers include internet platforms, financial institutions, and supply chain companies. Within a day of one breach, one of our customers used Overwatch to surface 18,000+ leaked credentials. Another used us to surface fraudulent checks and learn exactly how threat actors were targeting their specific product features.\u003cp\u003eOur website says “Request a demo” but if you want to poke around on a very basic example of how we’re aggregating dark web, deep web, social, and surface web, log in at \u003ca href=\"https://app.overwatchdata.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://app.overwatchdata.io/\u003c/a\u003e using these credentials:\n  username: try_overwatch@overwatchdata.io \n  pw: HelloHNWorld\u003cp\u003eThat login is for an un-personalized feed of cyber threat intel (breaches, vulnerabilities, ransomed organizations, and industry updates) that gives you a flavor of not just the kind of information from which we can collect, but more importantly, how our technology prioritizes, clusters, and summarizes alerts for cyber / fraud analysts. Try the chat agent on the left-hand side to parse through the data.\u003cp\u003eOr sign up for a longer trial and preview of our email alerts: \u003ca href=\"https://xryl45u9uep.typeform.com/to/pvtZQyS0\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://xryl45u9uep.typeform.com/to/pvtZQyS0\u003c/a\u003e.

Pricing is dependent on how complex a threat landscape our users want to monitor and we’re still figuring out how to standardize this but we’ll always do our best for the HN community.\u003cp\u003eSince the platform is AI-powered, it can also be used for news monitoring, supply chain disruptions, regulatory monitoring, or social media monitoring. We’ve had a lot of experience wrangling text-based feeds and using numerous AI-models (from embeddings, entity extractors, and LLMs) to filter, categorize, cluster, and analyze the data into meaning - so let us know if you’d like to nerd-out or have had any particular challenges. Looking forward to your feedback and questions!

With SDKs in JS/Java/Kotlin and a lightweight runtime built in Rust/Tokio.\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/restatedev/\"\u003ehttps://github.com/restatedev/\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://restate.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://restate.dev/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is free and open, SDKs are MIT-licensed, runtime permissive BSL (basically just the minimal Amazon defense).\nWe worked on that for a bit over a year. A few points I think are worth mentioning:\u003cp\u003e- Restate's runtime is a single binary, self-contained, no dependencies aside from a durable disk. It contains basically a lightweight integrated version of a durable log, workflow state machine, state storage, etc. That makes it very compact and easy to run both on a laptop and a server.\u003cp\u003e- Restate implements durable execution not only for workflows, but the core building block is durable RPC handlers (or event handler). It adds a few concepts on top of durable execution, like virtual objects (turn RPC handlers into virtual actors), durable communication, and durable promises. Here are more details: \u003ca href=\"https://restate.dev/programming-model\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://restate.dev/programming-model\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003e- Core design goal for APIs was to keep a familiar style. An app developer should look at Restate examples and say \"hey, that looks quite familiar\". You can let us know if that worked out.\u003cp\u003e- Basically every operation (handler invocation, step, ...) goes through a consensus layer, for a high degree of resilience and consistency.\u003cp\u003e- The lightweight log-centric architecture gives Restate still good latencies: For example around 50ms roundtrip (invoke to result) for a 3-step durable workflow handler (Restate on EBS with fsync for every step).\u003cp\u003eWe'd love to hear what you think of it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40659160\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40659160\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 135\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 100\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://restate.dev/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40659160","date_published":"2024-06-12T15:25:23Z","author":{"name":"sewen","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sewen"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40658901","title":"Star botanist likely made up data about nutritional supplements, new probe finds","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/star-botanist-likely-made-data-about-nutritional-supplements-new-probe-finds\"\u003ehttps://www.science.org/content/article/star-botanist-likely-made-data-about-nutritional-supplements-new-probe-finds\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40658901\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40658901\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 127\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 35\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.science.org/content/article/star-botanist-likely-made-data-about-nutritional-supplements-new-probe-finds","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40658901","date_published":"2024-06-12T14:59:04Z","author":{"name":"jyunwai","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jyunwai"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40658095","title":"Intel is trucking a 916k-pound 'Super Load' across Ohio to its new fab","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-is-trucking-a-916000-pound-super-load-across-ohio-to-its-new-fab-spawning-road-closures-over-nine-days\"\u003ehttps://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-is-trucking-a-916000-pound-super-load-across-ohio-to-its-new-fab-spawning-road-closures-over-nine-days\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40658095\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40658095\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 223\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 207\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-is-trucking-a-916000-pound-super-load-across-ohio-to-its-new-fab-spawning-road-closures-over-nine-days","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40658095","date_published":"2024-06-12T13:45:46Z","author":{"name":"prng2021","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=prng2021"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40657307","title":"Study shows N95 masks near-perfect at blocking escape of airborne Covid-19","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://sph.umd.edu/news/study-shows-n95-masks-near-perfect-blocking-escape-airborne-covid-19\"\u003ehttps://sph.umd.edu/news/study-shows-n95-masks-near-perfect-blocking-escape-airborne-covid-19\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40657307\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40657307\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 150\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 119\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://sph.umd.edu/news/study-shows-n95-masks-near-perfect-blocking-escape-airborne-covid-19","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40657307","date_published":"2024-06-12T12:28:23Z","author":{"name":"robtherobber","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=robtherobber"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40657238","title":"AI Detectors Get It Wrong.
