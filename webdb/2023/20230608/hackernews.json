Lesson: Always 'Show and Tell' Your Product Before You Develop It","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eIt's said that amazon asks their product makers to write a press release about the release of the product and work backwards from there.\u003cp\u003eWorking backwards has its uses...\u003cp\u003eI recently wanted validation on a product I had already finished developing\u003cp\u003eI thought I needed it so others will too. I put in a lot of time architecting it, designing it with careful UX and UI.\u003cp\u003eWhen it came time to show and tell through a demo video i couldn't create a simple enough one that explains what it does.\u003cp\u003eSo anyway I posted it in some communities and people we just confused and nobody signed up.\u003cp\u003eSo I had to abandon the project as there were no takers\u003cp\u003eCut to about a week back where I had another idea... This time instead of simply developing it further, I jumped straight to see if I can create a explainer video of the product. So with zero expectations about it working I made one without audio or music or even subtitles and posted on reddit.  It was just a screen recording of it working on my laptop.\u003cp\u003eTo my surprise people wanted it. Some even demanding it. I quickly put up a \"coming soon\" website to capture emails. 36 people gave their emails! Many more I could message on reddit once I am ready.\u003cp\u003eHere is the link to the reddit post...\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/13xm1s5/i_made_this_seo_keyword_searching_thingie_for_my/\u003cp\u003ehere is what I wrote...\u003cp\u003e-------\nHeadline: I made this SEO keyword searching thingie for my own needs... Does anyone want it? Its very ugly at the moment\u003cp\u003eDescription: Lets say you want to rank high on Google for the keyword \"pet dog care\"\u003cp\u003eBefore you write any content, you want to know what questions people ask on Google, Who is ranking on the top 10 and what other keywords do they rank for?, and 'Google Suggestions' for the phrase.\u003cp\u003eSo I made one and I find it damn bloody useful when creating highly relevant and SEO potimised content. Wonder if anyone else finds this stuff useful.\u003cp\u003eI have been burnt building unnecessary stuff before so I am very careful to validate first now. I will only develop this further is there is any interest here :-)\n-------\u003cp\u003eThe ugly video I shared... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-873SkJ2RI\u003cp\u003elink to the coming soon page... https://keywordranking.me/\u003cp\u003eNow I am developing the product into something others could use in collaboration with actual users and i have to do it fast since so many are waiting. This is a first for me. This is probably what product Market fit feels like... probably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca
