If you're too specific about the position, you get too few quality candidates. If you keep it too broad, you get swamped with applicants that you don't know what to do. I don't even want to get in people faking their jobs/positions/duties/diplomas etc. Also, job posting and application management platforms are usually quiet expensive. As a bonus: if you are a startup, hiring wrong people will most likely kill your company. The best method that works as per my opinion is working with an agency to give you better first results however again nothing comes for free.\u003cp\u003eMy view as job seeker: There are million companies and million posts. (especially with remote positions). LinkedIn is the platform that you can find more coverage yes however it doesn't usually represent the reality about the job/market. As first step, you start with the companies you like/know with being a bit more selective on the jobs but after some point you basically apply all somewhat related jobs and then want to see what happens after. (which only increase the complexity of the problem)\u003cp\u003eI am thinking to come up with a solution however I am not sure if there is a solution.\u003cp\u003eI guess my question here is that what else that you have experienced that worked/not worked. Also what would be the dream solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca

HN: Video streaming is expensive yet YouTube \"seems\" to do it for free. How?","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eCan anyone help me understand the economics of video streaming platforms?\u003cp\u003eStreaming, encoding, and storage demands enormous costs -- especially at scale (e.g., on average each 4k video with close to 1 million views).\nYet YouTube seems to charge no money for it.\u003cp\u003eI know advertisements are a thing for YT, but is it enough?\u003cp\u003eIf tomorrow I want to start a platform that is supported with Advert revenues, I know I will likely fail. However, maybe at YT scale (or more specifically Google Advert scale) the economics works?\u003cp\u003eps: I would like this discussion to focus on the absolute necessary elements (e.g., storing, encoding, streaming) and not on other factors contributing to latency/cost like running view count algorithms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40408515\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40408515\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 363\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 337\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40408515","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40408515","date_published":"2024-05-19T17:51:41Z","author":{"name":"pinakinathc","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pinakinathc"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40408040","title":"Russia's glide bombs devastating Ukraine's cities on the cheap","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz5drkr8l1ko\"\u003ehttps://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz5drkr8l1ko\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40408040\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40408040\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 102\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 114\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz5drkr8l1ko","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40408040","date_published":"2024-05-19T16:35:00Z","author":{"name":"rntn","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rntn"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40407927","title":"AI doppelgänger experiment – Part 1: The training","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://julienposture.substack.com/p/the-ai-doppelganger-experiment-part\"\u003ehttps://julienposture.substack.com/p/the-ai-doppelganger-experiment-part\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40407927\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40407927\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 207\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 119\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://julienposture.substack.com/p/the-ai-doppelganger-experiment-part","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40407927","date_published":"2024-05-19T16:19:06Z","author":{"name":"julienposture","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=julienposture"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40407228","title":"Swarming Proxima Centauri: Picospacecraft Swarms over Interstellar Distances","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://astrobiology.com/2024/05/swarming-proxima-centauri-coherent-picospacecraft-swarms-over-interstellar-distances.html\"\u003ehttps://astrobiology.com/2024/05/swarming-proxima-centauri-coherent-picospacecraft-swarms-over-interstellar-distances.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40407228\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40407228\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 259\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 132\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://astrobiology.com/2024/05/swarming-proxima-centauri-coherent-picospacecraft-swarms-over-interstellar-distances.html","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40407228","date_published":"2024-05-19T14:33:10Z","author":{"name":"Brajeshwar","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Brajeshwar"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40405664","title":"Microwaves Not Made in China","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://www.aintfromchina.com/kitchen/microwaves.html\"\u003ehttps://www.aintfromchina.com/kitchen/microwaves.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40405664\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40405664\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 49\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 100\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.aintfromchina.com/kitchen/microwaves.html","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40405664","date_published":"2024-05-19T09:47:19Z","author":{"name":"KoftaBob","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=KoftaBob"}}]}
