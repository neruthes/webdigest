Modern apps rely heavily on third-party APIs (think payment processors, data providers, etc.), but once TLS kicks in, figuring out exactly what data is being sent, identifying PII exposure, or debugging integration issues becomes incredibly difficult without resorting to complex and often brittle solutions.\u003cp\u003eTraditional approaches like forward proxies require terminating TLS (MITM), managing certificates, and often introduce performance bottlenecks or single points of failure. Network firewalls usually operate at L3/L4 and lack payload visibility. We felt there had to be a better way.\u003cp\u003eThat's why we built qtap. It's a lightweight agent that uses eBPF to tap into network traffic at the kernel level. The key idea is to hook into common TLS libraries (like OpenSSL) before encryption and after decryption. This gives us deep visibility into the actual request/response payloads of HTTPS/TLS traffic without needing to terminate the connection or manage certs. Because it leverages eBPF, the performance impact is minimal compared to traditional methods.\u003cp\u003eWith qtap, we can now see exactly which external services our apps are talking to, inspect the payloads for debugging or security auditing (e.g., spotting accidental PII leaks), monitor API performance/errors for third-party dependencies, and get a much clearer picture of our egress traffic patterns.\u003cp\u003eWe've found this approach really powerful for improving reliability and security posture. We've packaged qtap as a Linux Binary, Docker container, and Helm chart for deployment.\u003cp\u003eThis is still evolving, but we're excited about the potential of using eBPF for this kind of deep, yet non-intrusive, visibility.\u003cp\u003eWe'd love to get the HN community's feedback:\u003cp\u003e\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e    Do you face similar challenges monitoring encrypted egress traffic?\n    What are your thoughts on using eBPF for this compared to other methods?\n    Any suggestions or potential use cases we haven't considered?\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\nHappy to

HN: How much better are AI IDEs vs. copy pasting into chat apps?","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eI just wanted to hear peoples experiences with AI IDEs.\u003cp\u003eFor context, I'm a heavy user of Gemini / ChatGPT for coding and Copilot. But I haven't used Cursor / Windsurf / etc..\u003cp\u003eCopy pasting into chat apps is a first world problem: it will do the work for you, but you have to give it all the context in the prompt, which for a larger project, gets tedious.\u003cp\u003eThe issue with Copilot is that it's not as smart as the \"thinking\" chat apps.\u003cp\u003eThis makes it clear why there's such a need for AI IDEs. I don't want to construct my context to a chat app. The context is already in my codebase, so the AI should pick up on it. But I also hear that it gets expensive because of the pay-per-use pricing, as opposed to effectively unlimited prompts for a thinking chat app if you pay the monthly subscription.\u003cp\u003eSo I just wanted to get the lay of the land. How good are these IDEs on constructing your context to the LLMs? How much more expensive is it, and is it worth it for you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43922759\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43922759\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 111\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 116\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43922759","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43922759","date_published":"2025-05-08T03:18:10Z","author":{"name":"lopatin","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=lopatin"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43921653","title":"Show HN: US Routing – Python library for fast local routing in the US","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/ivanbelenky/us-routing\"\u003ehttps://github.com/ivanbelenky/us-routing\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43921653\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43921653\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 111\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 26\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://github.com/ivanbelenky/us-routing","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43921653","date_published":"2025-05-07T23:51:32Z","author":{"name":"ivanbelenky","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ivanbelenky"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43921624","title":"Yggdrasil is an experimental compact routing scheme that is fully decentralised","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/about.html\"\u003ehttps://yggdrasil-network.github.io/about.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43921624\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43921624\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 181\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 50\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/about.html","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43921624","date_published":"2025-05-07T23:45:10Z","author":{"name":"doener","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=doener"}}]}
