We just launched nao, an AI code editor to work with data: a local editor, directly connected with your data warehouse, and powered by an AI copilot with built-in context of your data schema and data-specific tools.\u003cp\u003eSee our demo here: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmG6X-5ftZU\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmG6X-5ftZU\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eWriting code with LLMs is the new normal in software engineering. But not when it comes to manipulating data. Tools like Cursor don’t interact natively with data warehouses — they autocomplete SQL blindly, not knowing your data schema. Most of us are still juggling multiple tools: writing code in Cursor, checking results in the warehouse console, troubleshooting with an observability tool, and verifying in BI tool no dashboard broke.\u003cp\u003eWhen you want to write code on data with LLMs, you don’t care much about the code, you care about the data output. You need a tool that helps you write code relevant for your data, lets you visualize its impact on the output, and quality check it for you.\u003cp\u003eChristophe and I have each spent 10 years in data — Christophe was a data engineer and has built data platforms for dozens of orgs, I was head of data and helped data teams building their analytics \u0026 data products. We’ve seen how the business asks you to ship data fast, while you’re here wondering if this small line of code will mistakenly multiply the revenue on your CEO dashboard by x5. Which leaves you 2 choices: test extensively and ship slow. Not test and ship fast. That’s why we wanted to create nao: a tool really adapted to our data work, that would allow data teams to ship at business pace.\u003cp\u003enao is a fork of VS Code, with built-in connectors for BigQuery, Snowflake, and Postgres. We built our own AI copilot and tab system, gave them a RAG of your data warehouse schemas and of your codebase. We added a set of agent tools to query data, compare data, understand data tools like dbt, assess the downstream impact of code in your whole data lineage.\u003cp\u003eThe AI tab and the AI agent write straight away code matching your schema, may it be for SQL, python, yaml. It shows you code diffs and data diffs side by side, to visualize what your change did to the data output. And you can leave the data quality checks to the agent: detect missing or duplicated values, outliers, anticipate breaking changes downstream or compare dev and production data differences.\u003cp\u003eData teams usually use nao for writing SQL pipelines, often with dbt. It helps them create data models, document them, test them, while making sure they’re not breaking data lineage and figures in the BI. In run mode, they also use it to run some analytics, and identify data quality bugs in production. For less technical profiles, it’s also a great help to strengthen their code best practices. For large teams, it ensures that the code \u0026 metrics remain well factorized and consistent.\u003cp\u003eSoftware engineers use nao for the database exploration part: write SQL queries with nao tab, explore data schema with the agent, and write DDL.\u003cp\u003eQuestion we often get is: why not just use Cursor and MCPs? Cursor has to trigger many MCP calls to get full context of the data, while nao has it always available in one RAG. MCPs stay in a very enclosed part of Cursor: they don’t bring data context to the tab. And they don’t make the UI more adapted to data workflows. Besides, nao comes as pre-packaged for data teams: they don’t have to set up extensions, install and authenticate in MCPs, build CI/CD pipelines. Which means even non-technical data teams can have a great developer experience.\u003cp\u003eOur long-term goal is to become the best place to work with data. We want to fine-tune our own models for SQL, Python and YAML to give the most relevant code suggestions for data. We want to enlarge our comprehension of all data stack tools, to become the only agnostic editor for any of your data workflow.\u003cp\u003eYou can try it here: \u003ca href=\"https://sunshine.getnao.io/releases/\"\u003ehttps://sunshine.getnao.io/releases/\u003c/a\u003e - download nao, sign up for free and start using it. Just for HN Launch, you can create a temporary account with a simple username if you’d prefer not to use your email. For now, we only have Mac version but Linux and Windows are coming.\u003cp\u003eWe’d love to hear your feedback — and get your thoughts on how we can improve even further the data dev experience!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca

HN: Aberdeen – An elegant approach to reactive UIs","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eYes, another reactive UI framework for JavaScript. Bear with me, please... :-)\u003cp\u003eI 'invented' the concept for this back in 2011, and it was used (as a proprietary lib) in various startups. Even though \u003ci\u003emany\u003c/i\u003e similar open source libs have been released since, and boy have I tried a lot of them, none have been able to capture the elegance and DX of what we had back then. I might be biased though. :-)\u003cp\u003eSo I started creating a cleaned-up, modern, TypeScript, open source implementation for the concept about five years ago. After many iterations, working on the project on and off, I'm finally happy with its API and the developer experience it offers. I'm calling it 1.0!\u003cp\u003eThe concept: It uses many small, anonymous functions for emitting DOM elements, and automatically reruns them when their underlying proxied data changes. This proxied data can be anything from simple values to complex, typed, and deeply nested data structures.\u003cp\u003eAs I'm currently free to spend my time on labors of love like this, I'm planning to expand the ecosystem around this to include synchronizing data with a remote server/database, and to make CRUD apps very rapid and perhaps even pleasurable to implement.\u003cp\u003eI've celebrated 1.0 by creating a tutorial with editable interactive examples! \u003ca href=\"https://aberdeenjs.org/Tutorial/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://aberdeenjs.org/Tutorial/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eI would love to hear your feedback.
