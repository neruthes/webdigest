The idea is to make a single device that can act as both a relay station, as well as an actual hotspot, it then can be placed in line-of-sight configuration to potentially cover huge areas (the accepted performance would be anywhere from 0.1-1 Mbit/s point-to-point over anywhere from 5-20km. We are aiming to bring the cost of such configuration down to $100 per unit at least. Hopefully, we also wouldn't need to do so and somebody else could do the whole thing for us at a similar price... Where would you start, i.e. with the vendors, as well as the commodity hardware, firmware that should work best for a setup like this? Bonus points; if it can be somewhat be aware of the current happenstance.
