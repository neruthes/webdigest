My name is Anonyo, and I am a seventeen-year-old from Southeast Michigan. This is wallstreetlocal, my passion project for the last year (and a half). I've posted this before, but I've finally open-sourced this entire project, so I thought I'd post it again.\u003cp\u003eHeres the short pitch.\u003cp\u003eThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) keeps record of every company in the United States. Companies whose holdings surpass $100 million though, are required to file a special type of form: the 13F form. This form, filed quarterly, discloses the filer's holdings, providing transparency into their investment activities and allowing the public and other market participants to monitor them.\u003cp\u003eThe problem though, is that these holdings are often cumbersome to access, and valuable analysis is often hidden behind a paywall. Through wallstreetlocal, the SEC's 13F filers become more accessible and open.\u003cp\u003eBy exploring the website (and the code), you can see the resources I used, check out some notable money managers I listed, and download any data that suits you. All for free. (Note, the mobile site likely needs work.)\u003cp\u003eI made this project to better democratize SEC filings, and also to get some experience on my hands. I love computers, and one day hope to get involved with startups. In the comments, I'd appreciate any and all advice, as well as feedback on how to improve the site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39643833\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39643833\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 164\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 33\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://github.com/bruhbruhroblox/wallstreetlocal","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39643833","date_published":"2024-03-08T18:02:26Z","author":{"name":"anonyonoor","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=anonyonoor"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39643685","title":"Apple restores Epic's account in the EU","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1766158416093798866\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1766158416093798866\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39643685\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39643685\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 153\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 1\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1766158416093798866","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39643685","date_published":"2024-03-08T17:53:11Z","author":{"name":"milen","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=milen"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39643447","title":"Airbnb's Devastating Effect on Canadian Housing","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://thewalrus.ca/airbnbs-canadian-housing/\"\u003ehttps://thewalrus.ca/airbnbs-canadian-housing/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39643447\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39643447\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 124\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 242\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://thewalrus.ca/airbnbs-canadian-housing/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39643447","date_published":"2024-03-08T17:33:05Z","author":{"name":"pseudolus","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pseudolus"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39643136","title":"Show HN: Hatchet – Open-source distributed task queue","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHello HN, we're Gabe and Alexander from Hatchet (\u003ca href=\"https://hatchet.run\"\u003ehttps://hatchet.run\u003c/a\u003e), we're working on an open-source, distributed task queue. It's an alternative to tools like Celery for Python and BullMQ for Node.js, primarily focused on reliability and observability. It uses Postgres for the underlying queue.\u003cp\u003eWhy build another managed queue? We wanted to build something with the benefits of full transactional enqueueing - particularly for dependent, DAG-style execution - and felt strongly that Postgres solves for 99.9% of queueing use-cases better than most alternatives (Celery uses Redis or RabbitMQ as a broker, BullMQ uses Redis). Since the introduction of SKIP LOCKED and the milestones of recent PG releases (like active-active replication), it's becoming more feasible to horizontally scale Postgres across multiple regions and vertically scale to 10k TPS or more. Many queues (like BullMQ) are built on Redis and data loss can occur when suffering OOM if you're not careful, and using PG helps avoid an entire class of problems.\u003cp\u003eWe also wanted something that was significantly easier to use and debug for application developers. A lot of times the burden of building task observability falls on the infra/platform team (for example, asking the infra team to build a Grafana view for their tasks based on exported prom metrics). We're building this type of observability directly into Hatchet.\u003cp\u003eWhat do we mean by \"distributed\"? You can run workers (the instances which run tasks) across multiple VMs, clusters and regions - they are remotely invoked via a long-lived gRPC connection with the Hatchet queue. We've attempted to optimize our latency to get our task start times down to 25-50ms and much more optimization is on the roadmap.\u003cp\u003eWe also support a number of extra features that you'd expect, like retries, timeouts, cron schedules, dependent tasks. A few things we're currently working on - we use RabbitMQ (confusing, yes) for pub/sub between engine components and would prefer to just use Postgres, but didn't want to spend additional time on the exchange logic until we built a stable underlying queue. We are also considering the use of NATS for engine-engine and engine-worker connections.\u003cp\u003eWe'd greatly appreciate any feedback you have and hope you get the chance to try out Hatchet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca

HN: A directory of open source alternatives to proprietary software","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHi, Piotr here\u003cp\u003eI was collecting nice open-source companies for quite some time now. Mostly to take some inspiration and learn from their code.\u003cp\u003eLast week, I though it would be fun to learn this Astro thing everyone's talking about. So I thought building a directory website out of this collection was pretty good idea.\u003cp\u003eAfter 2 days of building, OpenAlternative was born. It's a community driven list of open source alternatives to proprietary software and applications.\u003cp\u003eEnjoy and thank you for your support!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39639386\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39639386\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 147\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 52\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://openalternative.co","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39639386","date_published":"2024-03-08T09:21:15Z","author":{"name":"piotrkulpinski","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=piotrkulpinski"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39639253","title":"Thierry Breton: Under DMA, there is no room for threats by gatekeepers","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ThierryBreton/status/1765793776692326891\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/ThierryBreton/status/1765793776692326891\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39639253\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39639253\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 130\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 105\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://twitter.com/ThierryBreton/status/1765793776692326891","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39639253","date_published":"2024-03-08T08:58:40Z","author":{"name":"beejiu","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=beejiu"}}]}
