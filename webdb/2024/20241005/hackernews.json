It unifies React Native and React web with typed file system routing by making Vite able to serve RN. This lets you share (or diverge) your code in a simpler way for cross-platform apps.\u003cp\u003e2. We've partnered with Zero (\u003ca href=\"https://zerosync.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://zerosync.dev\u003c/a\u003e) to make local-first work well. We've been building a solution in One that makes Zero supporting server rendering, without waterfalls, and with seamless server/client handoff.\u003cp\u003e---\u003cp\u003eHonestly - I'm a bit hesitant to post One here.\u003cp\u003eHN has really soured on frontend/frameworks. And I get it. We've collectively complicated the hell out of things.\u003cp\u003eThat's why I decided to build One. I loved Rails, it made me as a young developer able to finally realize way more ambitious projects than I'd ever done before. I also liked the promise (not implementation) of Meteor - it felt like the clear future, I guess just a bit too early (and a bit too scope-creeped).\u003cp\u003eI worked at Uniswap and built Tamagui and so spent a lot of time building cross-platform apps that share code. Uniswap is built on Tamagui and I think proves you \u003ci\u003ecan\u003c/i\u003e make really high quality UX while sharing a lot of code - but it's insanely hard and requires a huge team. My goal with One is to make what is now possible but hard dramatically easier.\u003cp\u003eAnd I think the path to there goes through local-first, because it makes building super responsive apps much, much simpler, and Zero is the first library to actually pull it off in a way that doesn't bloat your bundle or have very limiting constraints.\u003cp\u003eI happened to live down the street from Aaron, one of the founders of Zero, in our tiny town in Hawaii. We talked a lot about Zero over the last couple years, and I found it really admirable how he consistently chose the \"harder but better\" path in building it. It really shaped into something incredible, and that convinced me to actually launch One, which at the time was more of an experiment.\u003cp\u003eI can see a lot of potential criticism - do we need yet another framework, this is too shiny and vaporware-y, this is just more complexity and abstraction, etc. Happy to respond to those comments if they come.\u003cp\u003eI'm just building out something that I've been wanting for a long time. Opinionated enough to let me move fast like Rails, but leaning on the great work of team Zero so that we don't end up with the scope creep of Meteor. And honestly, it's just really fun to hack on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca
