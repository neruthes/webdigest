HN: How can my mom downshift as a SQL developer?","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHi all, I'm looking for some general advice about the right way to find a specific kind of job.\u003cp\u003eMy mom has 20 years of experience with Oracle SQL. She's an expert in that, but not in other dev stuff.\u003cp\u003eLong story short, their devision got sold to a startup, where she is now given responsibilities and workloads that are much more suited for a young, ambitious, competitive dev who wants a promotion.\u003cp\u003eIt's causing her considerable stress. Some examples of tasks she doesn't want to do:\u003cp\u003e1. Implement the migration of all data and data models to the new system in the new company, with strict deadlines.\u003cp\u003e2. Study and evaluate modern data warehouse and data lake solutions to provide an analytics product for customers.\u003cp\u003e3. Get paged on Thanksgiving weekend to fix some random crap that someone else broke.\u003cp\u003eIt's all fine work, but not for her, not at this stage in life.\u003cp\u003eShe wants to find a place to be comfy and write some SQL scripts, analysis, and data modeling here and there, where she will be both happy and useful. Pay is not a priority.\u003cp\u003eI guess what I'm asking is that I don't necessarily know what kind of title even fits that role, and where to find such leads. Is she looking for an analyst position? Is she more suited for a non-tech company, where her job description would not \"feature creep\"?\u003cp\u003eSo far my only advice to her was to go interview around at SQL positions around Chicago, and to go to meetups, (we actually went to a Postgres one together) but she's been through enough interviews where she's grilled with Google style questions where she's not really excited about going through it again. Just seeing if anyone has advice for finding such positions that I'm overlooking.\u003cp\u003eThank for your time all,\nHappy Thanksgiving\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL:
