HN: Moonrepo (YC W23) – Open-source build system","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHey HN, Miles and James here from Moonrepo (\u003ca href=\"https://moonrepo.dev\"\u003ehttps://moonrepo.dev\u003c/a\u003e). Are you struggling with large codebases? Well look no further! We built Moonrepo to simplify repository management, project ownership, task running, and everyday developer and productivity workflows.\u003cp\u003eIf you’ve used Bazel (or another “enterprise” build system) in the past, you’re probably aware of how complex they can be to setup, configure, and use. Let alone the cognitive overhead required by developers on a day to day basis. After more than a decade in the industry, with many of those years working on infrastructure and developer tooling related products, we set out to build Moon, a language agnostic build system.\u003cp\u003eExisting systems focused solely on runtime logistics (faster builds, concurrency), while we want to also focus on the developer experience. We do this by automating workflows as much as possible, in an effort to reduce manual work. We constantly sync and verify configuration, so that the repository stays in a healthy state. We also infer/detect as much as we can from the environment/repository/codebase, so pieces \"just work\".\u003cp\u003eWe wanted our system to be enjoyable to use and easy to understand, but also solve the same problems as existing systems. For example, configuration is in YAML, not a proprietary syntax. Tasks are defined and run as if you were running them in the terminal; no more abstractions like BUILD files. Unlike Bazel, we don’t hide or heavily rewrite terminal output, so the feedback loop is what you expect. We manage a toolchain, ensuring the correct version of languages is used (no more “works on my machine”). And lastly, our foundation is built on Rust and Tokio, so performance is first-class, the runtime is reliable, and memory safety is guaranteed.\u003cp\u003eWe follow the open core model. Moon is open source, but we’re also working on a few subscription-based services for monitoring and improving your continuous integration pipelines, a registry of project and code ownership, a continuous deployment/delivery board, auxiliary application systems, and more. We haven't finalized the subscription model yet, so there's no pricing information on the website. However, we do have a starter/free tier that everyone can use by registering on \u003ca href=\"https://moonrepo.app\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://moonrepo.app\u003c/a\u003e. In the future, we will offer on-prem as well.\u003cp\u003eAlthough Moonrepo is relatively new, we’re already feature-packed, stable, and used in production. We’re big fans of honest feedback, and look forward to your comments!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34885077\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34885077\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 128\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 101\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34885077","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34885077","date_published":"2023-02-21T18:48:10Z","author":{"name":"mileswjohnson","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mileswjohnson"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34884920","title":"EPA orders Norfolk Southern to conduct all cleanup actions related to derailment","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-orders-norfolk-southern-conduct-all-cleanup-actions-associated-east-palestine\"\u003ehttps://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-orders-norfolk-southern-conduct-all-cleanup-actions-associated-east-palestine\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34884920\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34884920\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 211\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 218\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-orders-norfolk-southern-conduct-all-cleanup-actions-associated-east-palestine","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34884920","date_published":"2023-02-21T18:37:47Z","author":{"name":"Jimmc414","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Jimmc414"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34884612","title":"Supreme Court declines to hear Wikimedia's challenge to NSA mass surveillance","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://diff.wikimedia.org/2023/02/21/u-s-supreme-court-declines-to-hear-wikimedia-foundations-challenge-to-nsa-mass-surveillance/\"\u003ehttps://diff.wikimedia.org/2023/02/21/u-s-supreme-court-declines-to-hear-wikimedia-foundations-challenge-to-nsa-mass-surveillance/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34884612\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34884612\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 220\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 69\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://diff.wikimedia.org/2023/02/21/u-s-supreme-court-declines-to-hear-wikimedia-foundations-challenge-to-nsa-mass-surveillance/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34884612","date_published":"2023-02-21T18:15:27Z","author":{"name":"Amorymeltzer","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Amorymeltzer"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34884412","title":"Saying goodbye to Stack Overflow","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/116vvpp/saying_goodbye_to_stack_overflow/\"\u003ehttps://old.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/116vvpp/saying_goodbye_to_stack_overflow/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34884412\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34884412\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 214\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 268\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://old.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/116vvpp/saying_goodbye_to_stack_overflow/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34884412","date_published":"2023-02-21T18:01:00Z","author":{"name":"mooreds","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mooreds"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34884338","title":"Show HN: Phind.com – Generative AI search engine for developers","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHi HN,\u003cp\u003eToday we're launching phind.com, a developer-focused search engine that uses generative AI to browse the web and answer technical questions, complete with code examples and detailed explanations. It's version 1.0 of what was previously known as Hello (beta.sayhello.so) and has been completely reworked to be more accurate and reliable.\u003cp\u003eBecause it's connected to the internet, Phind is always up-to-date and has access to docs, issues, and bugs that ChatGPT hasn't seen. Like ChatGPT, you can ask followup questions. Phind is smart enough to perform a new search and join it with the existing conversation context. We're merging the best of ChatGPT with the best of Google.\u003cp\u003eYou're probably wondering how it's different from the new Bing. For one, we don't dumb down a user's query the way that the new Bing does. We feed your question into the model exactly as it was asked, and are laser-focused on providing developers the most detailed and comprehensive explanations to code-related questions. Secondly, we've focused the model on providing answers instead of chatbot small talk. This is one of the major improvements we've made since exiting beta.\u003cp\u003ePhind has the creative abilities to generate code, write essays, and even compose some poems/raps but isn't interested in having a conversation for conversation's sake. It should refuse to state its own opinion and rather provide a comprehensive summary of what it found online. When it isn't sure, it's designed to say so. It's not perfect yet, and misinterprets answers ~5% of the time. An example of Phind's adversarial question answering ability is \u003ca href=\"https://phind.com/search?q=why+is+replacing+NaCL+with+NaCN+in+a+cooking+recipe+good+for+you\"\u003ehttps://phind.com/search?q=why+is+replacing+NaCL+with+NaCN+i...\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cp\u003eChatGPT became useful by learning to generate answers it thinks humans will find helpful, via a technique called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). In RLHF, a model generates multiple candidate answers for a given question and a human rates which one is better. The comparison data is then fed back into the model through an algorithm such as PPO. To improve answer quality, we're deploying RLAIF — an improvement over RLHF where the AI itself generates comparison data instead of humans. Generative LLMs have already reached the point where they can review the quality of their own answers as good or better than an average human rater tasked with annotating data for RLHF.\u003cp\u003eWe still have a long way to go, but Phind is state-of-the-art at answering complex technical questions and writing intricate guides all while citing its sources. We'd love to hear your feedback.\u003cp\u003eExamples:\u003cp\u003e\u003ca
