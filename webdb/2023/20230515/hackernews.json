I think the lack of good data for \"how I'm sitting\" can result in unsavory posture choices throughout the day, so by adding data or visibility to the equation, I am now able to do something about it.  Sure, you can do it with one mirror, but something about having two distinct angles gives extra nuance for tilt and lean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca
