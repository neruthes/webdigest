Things snowballed quickly, I started talking to publishers, then worked like crazy through all of 2024, almost the hardest I've ever worked in my career, and launched the game in December 2024.

We’re working on putting fusion reactors on ships—specifically, large container ships and defence applications. Should be easy!\u003cp\u003eYes, we know: fusion has been the energy source of the future…and it always will be. But high-temperature superconductors (HTS) have changed the game for magnetic confinement, and we believe we’ll witness Q \u003e 1 within a few (say 3) years. That’s huge.\u003cp\u003e(Side note: Q is the ratio of input power divided by output power. Q\u003e 1 means the reactor is producing more power than it consumes, achieving ‘breakeven.’)\u003cp\u003eHowever, getting to breakeven is just the first daunting challenge. Making the first-of-a-kind (FOAK) reactors cost-competitive on the grid? That might be even harder than achieving breakeven.\u003cp\u003eThat’s why we’re taking this soon-to-be breakthrough in fusion and applying it to the first market we believe makes sense: ships.\u003cp\u003eInstead of targeting 24/7 baseload grid electricity—where fusion has to compete with solar, wind, batteries, and natural gas—we’re focusing on large commercial shipping (\u003e10,000 TEU) and mobile military vessels to provide ship-to-shore power capability.\u003cp\u003eWhy ships? They don’t have great alternatives—the shipping industry is desperate to decarbonize. Hydrogen and ammonia are being explored, but come with serious downsides: low energy density, flammability, leaks, and massive infrastructure challenges. Fusion will provide a high-energy-density, long-range solution without the same infrastructure challenges—once it works, of course!\u003cp\u003eOne common question is, why not fission? Fission works technically, but not practically. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) \u003ci\u003ecould\u003c/i\u003e power ships, but licensing fission reactors on land is already brutally hard and expensive—doing it for vessels moving between international ports with enriched uranium is nearly impossible. Public perception is another major barrier: if we’re deploying thousands of nuclear reactors globally, they need to be meltdown-proof. Fusion is the only way to guarantee that. Regulation also isn’t as bad. While fusion won’t be a walk in the park to license, the NRC has declared a distinct framework for it—more like particle accelerators and hospitals than nuclear power plants. That’s a game-changer.\u003cp\u003eInstead of a 500+ MW grid-scale reactor, our system is 25 MWe, designed for ship propulsion. Our tokamak is roughly JET-sized, but with HTS magnets (8-9T) and higher plasma current (~10MA). The first-wall power flux is down from multi-MW/m² to nearly 500 kW/m²—still tough, but not nightmare mode. The materials challenges associated with the first wall and nuclear activation of the structures is greatly reduced. Also, ships don’t require 90% uptime like grid power plants. Downtime for maintenance is part of normal operations, making this a far more forgiving early application of fusion, unlike the grid where every down hour is lost revenue.\u003cp\u003eJason and I come from SpaceX and Tesla, where we solved hard engineering problems at scale. My background is nuclear engineering (NC State, BS) and plasma physics (Columbia University, MS). We’ve been busy during our time in YC making technical progress on our reactor design, and are in the process of assembling a team of engineers who can pull this off.\u003cp\u003eThis is a ridiculously hard problem, of course. But we think it’s the right hard problem—one that’s actually solvable (and worth solving!) with today’s tech if applied correctly. Eventually the cheaper and more robust SOAK and NOAK (second-of-a-kind and nth-of-a-kind) reactors will arrive in the coming decades (2050-2060) and then we'll pivot to decarbonising the grid and saving the world (we'll need to change our name), but until then we'll be out in the ocean!\u003cp\u003eWould love to hear your thoughts—whether you’re deep into plasma physics and engineering, skeptical-but–curious, or convinced it will never work .

We started Jamsocket a few years ago as a way to run ephemeral servers that last for as long as a WebSocket connection. We sandboxed those servers, so with the rise of LLMs we started to see people use them for arbitrary code execution.\u003cp\u003eWhile this works, it was clunkier than what we would have wanted in a first-principles code execution product. We built ForeverVM from scratch to be that product.\u003cp\u003eIn particular, it felt clunky for app developers to have to think about sandboxes starting and stopping, so the core tenet of ForeverVM is using memory snapshotting to create the abstraction of a Python REPL that lives forever.\u003cp\u003eWhen you go on our site, you are given a live Python repl, try it out!\u003cp\u003e---\u003cp\u003eEdit: here's a bit more about why/when/how this can be used:\u003cp\u003eLLMs are often given extra abilities through \"tools\", which are generally wrappers around API calls. For a lot of tasks (sending an email, fetching data from well-known sources), the LLM knows how to write Python code to accomplish the same.\u003cp\u003eAny time the LLM needs to do a specific calculation or process data in a loop, we find it is better to generate code than try to do this in the LLM itself.\u003cp\u003eWe have an integration with Anthropic's Model Context Protocol, which is also supported by a lot of IDEs like Cursor and Windsurf. One surprising thing we've found is that once installed, when we ask a question about Python, the LLM will see that ForeverVM is available as a tool and verify it automatically!

This is an open source project I've been working on for a while. It's actually the third breakout-like game I've built. I really like the simplicity of the concept, having just one input (the puck horizontal position) and a simple gameplay that gives a low skill floor.\u003cp\u003eMy girlfriend and I played a lot of the excellent LBreakoutHD, an open source breakout game that follows the traditional formula of having multiple lives, scoring points by breaking bricks and catching the good upgrades that spawn randomly and fall down, while avoiding bad upgrades.\u003cp\u003eShe liked this game because it is non-violent, and doesn't make her sick like the first person 3D games. There are some issues  though, it gets boring to break the last bricks, it's a bit unfair or slow sometimes, and the run length is too long with 30 something levels to clear for a high score.\u003cp\u003eI wanted to make a clone that would be fix those issues. I first tried to introduce more strategy by making the upgrades visible from the start, instead of them appearing randomly. You'd then strategize what to break first to earn more points. That first version is playable (\u003ca href=\"https://breakout-v1.lecaro.me/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://breakout-v1.lecaro.me/\u003c/a\u003e) but a bit too complex.\u003cp\u003eI then wanted to simplify the gameplay, but make the game multiplayer in split screen (\u003ca href=\"https://breakout-v2.lecaro.me/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://breakout-v2.lecaro.me/\u003c/a\u003e). Instead of bonus and malus, each brick drops some coins, and you need to catch them with the puck. This worked pretty well. You can play with the keyboard (A/D and LEFT/RIGHT keys) or mouse or both. The bomb explosions will blow coins around, including the coins of other players, and if you lose your ball, then a gap opens between your screen and the guy next to you, to give him a chance to lend you his ball. You can play using your phone as a controller by scanning the QR code, but make sure everyone is on the same Wi-Fi and that the the firewalls are down.\u003cp\u003eFor my last version (\u003ca href=\"https://breakout.lecaro.me/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://breakout.lecaro.me/\u003c/a\u003e) is focused on the game feel and juice. It is about breaking bricks and catching coins, like the v2, but you can now pick upgrades at the end of each level. Your score unlocks more upgrades and levels that are added to the pool for the next runs. There are currently 31 upgrades and 91 levels to unlock.\u003cp\u003ePlease have a try and tell me what you think. The game should run well on Firefox, safari and chrome on mobile and pc. It is available in F-Droid and on the play store, The source code is on GitLab. All links are in the game menu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43183131\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43183131\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 221\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 112\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://breakout.lecaro.me/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43183131","date_published":"2025-02-26T12:42:35Z","author":{"name":"lecarore","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=lecarore"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43182892","title":"State of emergency declared after blackout plunges most of Chile into darkness","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/25/americas/chile-blackout-14-regions-intl-latam/index.html\"\u003ehttps://www.cnn.com/2025/02/25/americas/chile-blackout-14-regions-intl-latam/index.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43182892\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43182892\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 176\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 188\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/25/americas/chile-blackout-14-regions-intl-latam/index.html","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43182892","date_published":"2025-02-26T12:03:11Z","author":{"name":"impish9208","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=impish9208"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43182854","title":"The Miserable State of Modems and Mobile Network Operators","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://blog.golioth.io/the-miserable-state-of-modems-and-mobile-network-operators/\"\u003ehttps://blog.golioth.io/the-miserable-state-of-modems-and-mobile-network-operators/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43182854\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43182854\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 120\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 34\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://blog.golioth.io/the-miserable-state-of-modems-and-mobile-network-operators/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43182854","date_published":"2025-02-26T11:55:26Z","author":{"name":"hasheddan","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hasheddan"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43182576","title":"Automattic Hit with Class Action over WP Engine Dispute","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://www.therepository.email/automattic-hit-with-class-action-over-wp-engine-dispute-accused-of-anti-competitive-tactics\"\u003ehttps://www.therepository.email/automattic-hit-with-class-action-over-wp-engine-dispute-accused-of-anti-competitive-tactics\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43182576\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43182576\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 113\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 81\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.therepository.email/automattic-hit-with-class-action-over-wp-engine-dispute-accused-of-anti-competitive-tactics","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43182576","date_published":"2025-02-26T10:48:29Z","author":{"name":"rpgbr","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rpgbr"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43182325","title":"The FFT Strikes Back: An Efficient Alternative to Self-Attention","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18394\"\u003ehttps://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18394\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43182325\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43182325\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 350\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 131\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18394","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43182325","date_published":"2025-02-26T09:57:23Z","author":{"name":"iNic","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=iNic"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43181862","title":"Show HN: Telescope – an open-source web-based log viewer for logs in ClickHouse","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHey everyone!
