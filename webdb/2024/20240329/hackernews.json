href=\"https://pointone.ai\"\u003ehttps://pointone.ai\u003c/a\u003e).

What most clients donâ€™t realize is how painful it is for lawyers to track all their work in 6-minute increments. Lawyers hate time tracking, and many say itâ€™s the worst part of their jobs.\u003cp\u003eAdrian started out his career as a corporate lawyer at Fenwick \u0026 West. The first thing he was taught was how to track and bill his time. Between the 70-hour work weeks and billing to 10-15+ clients per day, staying on top of timesheets is surprisingly hard. To make things worse, law firms are extremely particular about how narratives (that is, descriptions of tasks performed) are craftedâ€”down to the punctuation and diction required. So, Adrian became chronically delinquent in submitting his timesheets, and the firm threatened to take away his bonus multiple times as a result.\u003cp\u003eAttorney time tracking is not a new problem, and companies have been promising to solve it for years. But pre-LLM attempts at automatic timekeeping never worked as advertised. We were inspired by products like Rewind, and felt that a narrower vertical application could finally solve this problem for lawyers.\u003cp\u003eOur product is a desktop application that a lawyer turns on at the start of their work day. It runs passively in the background and captures logs from everywhere they work: the OS itself, Word, Excel, calendar, emails, web browser, Slack/Teams, etc. We then clean, pre-process, and interpret the logs. Modern LLMs enable a bunch of cool features. For example, we can pull subtle context from an attorneyâ€™s browser activity to associate that work with a client. And for each client and project, we use these models to generate a time entry with a narrative description that matches both the firmâ€™s and the clientâ€™s style preferences.\u003cp\u003eBesides the fact that lawyers hate timekeeping, using PointOne lets them be sure that theyâ€™re not letting time slip through the cracks, and frees up hours per week they can spend on other things. It also helps firm leadership by getting more consistent narratives, and faster timesheet submission.\u003cp\u003eGiven the sensitivity of the data captured, privacy and security are massively important. As such, we have customizable data retention periods, we do not use firm data to update models, and we encrypt all data (in addition to employing other standard practices for processing confidential data).\u003cp\u003eSince our app primarily works for legal workflows, it might not be super useful for \u003ci\u003emost\u003c/i\u003e people here (maybe some though!). We would love it if you could check out our demo video, leave your thoughts in the comments, and introduce us to any lawyers you know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39842617\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39842617\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 135\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 116\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39842617","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39842617","date_published":"2024-03-27T18:10:57Z","author":{"name":"jeremybenmeir","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jeremybenmeir"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39841703","title":"MTA board votes to approve new $15 toll to drive into Manhattan","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/business/nyc-congestion-pricing-tolls-mta.html\"\u003ehttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/business/nyc-congestion-pricing-tolls-mta.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39841703\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39841703\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 382\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 763\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/business/nyc-congestion-pricing-tolls-mta.html","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39841703","date_published":"2024-03-27T17:03:22Z","author":{"name":"jaredwiener","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jaredwiener"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39841618","title":"Amazon spends another $2.7B on Anthropic","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/27/amazon-spends-2point7b-on-startup-anthropic-in-largest-venture-investment.html\"\u003ehttps://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/27/amazon-spends-2point7b-on-startup-anthropic-in-largest-venture-investment.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39841618\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39841618\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 201\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 115\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/27/amazon-spends-2point7b-on-startup-anthropic-in-largest-venture-investment.html","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39841618","date_published":"2024-03-27T16:56:23Z","author":{"name":"coloneltcb","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=coloneltcb"}}]}
