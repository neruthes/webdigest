HN: Phind V2 – A GPT-4 agent that’s connected to the internet and your code","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHi HN - Today we’re launching V2 of Phind.com, an assistant for programmers that combines GPT-4 with the ability to search the web and your codebase to solve nearly any technical problem – no matter how difficult.\u003cp\u003eWe’re incredibly grateful for the feedback we received when we first launched GPT-4 answers back in April (\u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35543668\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35543668\u003c/a\u003e). As Phind has gotten better at complex programming tasks, the questions it gets asked have gotten more complex as well. In the past, we would always perform a web search for every input. This limitation constrained Phind’s answers to what was present in the search results, preventing us from making Phind a more powerful debugger and making it challenging to integrate Phind with your codebase.\u003cp\u003eWe’ve addressed all these shortcomings in Phind V2. This release has three major updates: (1) Phind is now a pair programming agent that knows when to browse the web, ask clarifying questions, and call itself recursively; (2) the answering engine defaults to GPT-4, and you can use it without a login; (3) we integrate with your codebase via our new VS Code extension.\u003cp\u003eWe realized that search is only one of many tools that Phind should be able to use. As such, Phind has been re-engineered to be an agent that can dynamically choose whatever tool best helps the user – it’s now smart enough to decide when to search and when to enter a specialized debug mode. Instead of making assumptions about your code and proceeding blindly, Phind can ask you questions and clarify its assumptions. When a problem requires multiple searches or logical steps to solve, Phind can call itself recursively and perform multi-step reasoning without user input.\u003cp\u003eWe’ve heard from you that switching between your IDE and Phind in the browser has been a major pain point. No longer – we’re launching a VS Code extension that brings Phind into the IDE and finally connects Phind with the context of your codebase. Phind in VS Code automatically determines which parts of your code are relevant to your search and can help you squash bugs in a single click.\u003cp\u003eTo maximize Phind’s alignment with your preferred answer style, we’ve also added a feature called Answer Profile where you can tell the AI about yourself. Phind will apply this answering style across the board, automatically.\u003cp\u003eHere are some examples of the new Phind answering questions it could not before:\u003cp\u003eClarifying assumptions

HN: GitStart (YC S19) – Remote junior devs working on production PRs","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHi HN, I’m Hamza from GitStart (\u003ca href=\"https://gitstart.com/\"\u003ehttps://gitstart.com/\u003c/a\u003e). We’re building a service for engineering teams to assign tickets and get back PRs. Here’s a video of how it works: \u003ca href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/61d46a5b07e04b45a51af2a5008ee173\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"\u003ehttps://www.loom.com/share/61d46a5b07e04b45a51af2a5008ee173\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe recruit devs who want to grow from remote countries, to work full-time on these tickets and review each other’s PRs. For tech teams it’s pay as you go, and they only pay if they merge the PRs (we pay our devs a base regardless). \nGitStart is very personal to me because I struggled myself to start my career as a junior dev. Being born in Pakistan made it super hard to find my first remote job. Things changed with Google Summer of Code, which was the first time I got paid to contribute to a large production codebase.\u003cp\u003eWhen I became a staff engineer, I started mentoring junior devs on their solo projects. I then realized what they really needed was production code experience, so I started sending them tickets from my backlog to grow them through code reviews. I also paid them for it. They learned a lot and I got a lot done, which started GitStart.\u003cp\u003eThat’s why, in the description above, we say “devs who want to grow”. This is key to what we do—we are not just a body shop or middleman, and we don’t charge by the hour. We provide useful mentorship to junior devs. We want to be a meaningful part of their career path.\u003cp\u003eOur thesis (to use that slightly pretentious word) is that the economics work better this way as well. There is a lot of junior dev talent in these countries whose potential will bever be realized by hourly piecework. What’s needed are longer term relationships and work engagements, over the course of which a junior dev can learn and grow on a large production codebase. Much of this has to do with learning the culture of effective tech teams.\u003cp\u003eOn the other side, effective tech teams don’t want hourly piecework either. Clients tell us they love having developers dedicated to their project, becoming more familiar with the code over time. This is the way for value to be maximized on both sides.\u003cp\u003eA number of commercial open source repos already use us, so you can check out some of the PRs created by GitStart here:\u003cp\u003eCal.com: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Agitstart-calcom+is%3Aclosed\"\u003ehttps://github.com/calcom/cal.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ag...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eSourceGraph: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Agitstart-sourcegraph+is%3Aclosed\"\u003ehttps://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pulls?q=is%3Apr+a...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eStoryBooks: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Agitstart+is%3Aclosed\"\u003ehttps://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/pulls?q=is%3Apr+aut...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eStrapi: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/strapi/strapi/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed+is%3Apr+author%3Agitstart\"\u003ehttps://github.com/strapi/strapi/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed+is%3Apr...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eSupabase: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/supabase/supabase/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Agitstart+is%3Aclosed\"\u003ehttps://github.com/supabase/supabase/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eTwenty: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Agitstart-twenty+is%3Aclosed\"\u003ehttps://github.com/twentyhq/twenty/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3A...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur main technical challenge has been securing code sharing. One solution was building GitSlice, which enables creating sub-repos that sync with the upstream repo. When GitStart devs create PRs on the platform, GitSlice syncs them upstream while pulling back CI/CD checks and review comments. This enables our devs to contribute with limited codebase access.\u003cp\u003eTo prevent slices from breaking, we verify they run within a docker container, which also enables us to build review environments. Fun fact: we managed to support native iOS and Android codebases by building and running them on appetize.io instead of docker.\u003cp\u003eThere have been countless attempts at this space so we would love to hear your feedback on how we approached this problem or your past experiences working with junior devs in this way. We look forward to a good conversation!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37033753\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37033753\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 141\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 134\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37033753","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37033753","date_published":"2023-08-07T12:54:18Z","author":{"name":"hzia","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hzia"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37033652","title":"Ask HN: What's the coolest physical thing you've made?","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eCould be a painting, or a boat.
