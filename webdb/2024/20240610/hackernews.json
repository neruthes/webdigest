It would probably take another 6-12 months of intense training to get them somewhat productive, and several years to get them closer to the level we hired them at, assuming we can accelerate their learning.\u003cp\u003eThis would require addressing the elephant in the room that they're not at the level we assumed, so that they will understand why we're changing the work mode, accept that learning should be a high priority, and feel permitted to seek more help when they need it. We probably can't reduce the salary, so more productive devs might also be offended if they become aware of it.\u003cp\u003eEven if we were to successfully address this elephant in the room, they might at some point realize they can't catch up to the level they were hired at without years of dedicated effort and thus quit or \"quit internally\", making our investment pointless.\u003cp\u003eI guess in most companies this would be a no-brainer, but we're a small outfit with a focus on personal development, intrinsic motivation, good climate, and low turnover.\u003cp\u003eDo you think there is any way to rescue this situation? Or should we make this (perhaps justifiably, after their misleading self-presentation) the first time we let someone go for performance reasons?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments
