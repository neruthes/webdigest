We're building Nxtscape (\"next-scape\") - an open-source, agentic browser for the AI era.\u003cp\u003e-- Why bother building a new browser?\nFor the first time since Netscape was released in 1994, it feels like we can reimagine browsers from scratch for the age of AI agents. The web browser of tomorrow might not look like what we have today.\u003cp\u003eWe saw how tools like Cursor gave developers a 10x productivity boost, yet the browser—where everyone else spends their entire workday—hasn't fundamentally changed.\u003cp\u003eAnd honestly, we feel like we're constantly fighting the browser we use every day. It's not one big thing, but a series of small, constant frustrations. I'll have 70+ tabs open from three different projects and completely lose my train of thought. And simple stuff like reordering tide pods from amazon or filling out forms shouldn't need our full attention anymore. AI can handle all of this, and that's exactly what we're building.\u003cp\u003eHere’s a demo of our early version \u003ca href=\"https://dub.sh/nxtscape-demo\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://dub.sh/nxtscape-demo\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003e-- What makes us different\nWe know others are exploring this space (Perplexity, Dia), but we want to build something open-source and community-driven. We're not a search or ads company, so we can focus on being privacy-first – Ollama integration, BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys), ad-blocker.\u003cp\u003eBtw we love what Brave started and stood for, but they've now spread themselves too thin across crypto, search, etc. We are laser-focused on one thing: making browsers work for YOU with AI. And unlike Arc (which we loved too but got abandoned), we're 100% open source. Fork us if you don't like our direction.\u003cp\u003e-- Our journey hacking a new browser\nTo build this, we had to fork Chromium. Honestly, it feels like the only viable path today—we've seen others like Brave (started with electron) and Microsoft Edge learn this the hard way.\u003cp\u003eWe also started with why not just build an extension. But realized we needed more control. Similar to the reason why Cursor forked VSCode. For example, Chrome has this thing called the Accessibility Tree - basically a cleaner, semantic version of the DOM that screen readers use. Perfect for AI agents to understand pages, but you can't use it through extension APIs.\u003cp\u003eThat said, working with the 15M-line C++ chromium codebase has been an adventure. We've both worked on infra at Google and Meta, but Chromium is a different beast. Tools like Cursor's indexing completely break at this scale, so we've had to get really good with grep and vim. And the build times are brutal—even with our maxed-out M4 Max MacBook, a full build takes about 3 hours.\u003cp\u003eFull disclosure: we are still very early, but we have a working prototype on GitHub. It includes an early version of a \"local Manus\" style agent that can automate simple web tasks, plus an AI sidebar for questions, and other productivity features (grouping tabs, saving/resuming sessions, etc.).\u003cp\u003eLooking forward to any and all comments!\u003cp\u003eYou can download the browser from our github page: \u003ca
