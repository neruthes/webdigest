HN: I spent 2 years building a personal finance simulator","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHey everyone! After another year of building as a solo dev on nights and weekends, I'm back with an update on this post: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31083093\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31083093\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cp\u003eTL;DR - ProjectionLab (\u003ca href=\"https://projectionlab.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"\u003ehttps://projectionlab.com\u003c/a\u003e) is a privacy-friendly personal finance planning tool where you can create financial plans that go beyond the standard online retirement calculators. And by popular request, it now supports self-hosting for Lifetime users!\u003cp\u003eSomething I'm grateful for is that our community here on HN is the difference between PL existing and not. There was actually a time early on when I was one day away from halting work on it. I posted here on a whim, and was shocked to receive some really constructive and energizing feedback that went on to power my indie dev journey over the past two and a half years.\u003cp\u003eAs a quick recap, the story started when I dove head-first down the financial independence rabbit hole. I wanted a hands-on and visual way to explore the trade-offs between different life paths. One thing led to another, and I decided to build ProjectionLab.\u003cp\u003eAfter last year's Show HN, I really put my nose to the grindstone, and here are some of the big developments:\u003cp\u003e- Self-hosting for Lifetime users (spin up your own private deployment, based on Docker Compose, includes support for auth/encryption)\u003cp\u003e- Cash-flow visualization for each simulated year (sankey charts)\u003cp\u003e- Tax analytics (detailed breakdowns for projected income, taxes, marginal rates, effective brackets, etc)\u003cp\u003e- Major redesign of entire app, with landing page and resources now split into separate project\u003cp\u003e- Filing separately option to improve support for international locations that don't have joint filing\u003cp\u003e- Roth Conversions and 72t (SEPP) distribution modeling\u003cp\u003e- Improvements to US tax estimation (Secure 2.0 updates, rental property tax deductions, Medicare + IRMAA, NIIT, principal residence exclusion, etc)\u003cp\u003e- Better support for planning as a couple\u003cp\u003e- More modeling options for cash-flow priorities to support different budgeting philosophies and goals\u003cp\u003e- Extra liquidity + withdrawal options, ability to fund expenses with specific accounts or route income to specific accounts\u003cp\u003e- Customization options for Monte Carlo simulations (characterization of success rates and outcome types, option to set random seed, etc)\u003cp\u003e- And a whole bunch more! (\u003ca href=\"https://projectionlab.com/changelog\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"\u003ehttps://projectionlab.com/changelog\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cp\u003eThe HN community has had a huge role in shaping my overall direction with PL, and I can't wait to hear what you all think of the updates and where you would like to see things go from here.\u003cp\u003eAs always, PL is free to try, with no need to create an account. It does not ask to link your financial accounts, and it has a sandbox mode if you just want to hop in and see how it works.\u003cp\u003e--Kyle\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36849502\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36849502\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 433\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 147\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://projectionlab.com/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36849502","date_published":"2023-07-24T15:25:06Z","author":{"name":"scubakid","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=scubakid"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36849478","title":"Wasm_of_OCaml","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/ocaml-wasm/wasm_of_ocaml\"\u003ehttps://github.com/ocaml-wasm/wasm_of_ocaml\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36849478\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36849478\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 106\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 38\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://github.com/ocaml-wasm/wasm_of_ocaml","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36849478","date_published":"2023-07-24T15:23:30Z","author":{"name":"eriangazag","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=eriangazag"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36848680","title":"Zenbleed","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/zenbleed.html\"\u003ehttps://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/zenbleed.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36848680\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36848680\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 780\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 244\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/zenbleed.html","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36848680","date_published":"2023-07-24T14:34:31Z","author":{"name":"loeg","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=loeg"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36848037","title":"Atari has launched collectible arcade circuit boards of retro classics","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://retrododo.com/atari-collectible-arcade-circuit-boards/\"\u003ehttps://retrododo.com/atari-collectible-arcade-circuit-boards/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36848037\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36848037\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 114\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 60\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://retrododo.com/atari-collectible-arcade-circuit-boards/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36848037","date_published":"2023-07-24T13:55:08Z","author":{"name":"ajdude","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ajdude"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36847960","title":"Show HN: I built a transit travel time map","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eThis was something I built while trying to look for housing in Toronto that was decently transit-accessible to my office while still cheap.\u003cp\u003eThe backend is written in Rust.
