HN: Sourcebot, an open-source Sourcegraph alternative","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHi HN,\u003cp\u003eWe’re Brendan and Michael, the creators of Sourcebot (\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot\"\u003ehttps://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot\u003c/a\u003e). Sourcebot is an open-source code search tool that allows you to quickly search across many large codebases. Check out our demo video here: \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/mrIFYSB_1F4\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/mrIFYSB_1F4\u003c/a\u003e, or try it for yourself on our demo site here: \u003ca href=\"https://demo.sourcebot.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://demo.sourcebot.dev\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile at prior roles, we’ve both felt the pain of searching across hundreds of multi-million line codebases. Using local tools like grep were ill-suited since you often only had a handful of codebases checked out at a time. Sourcegraph (\u003ca href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://sourcegraph.com/\u003c/a\u003e) solves this issue by indexing a collection of codebases in the background and exposing a web-based search interface. It is the de-facto search solution for medium to large orgs, but is often cited as expensive ($49 per user / month) and recently went closed source (\u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41296481\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41296481\u003c/a\u003e). That’s why we built Sourcebot.\u003cp\u003eWe designed Sourcebot to be:\u003cp\u003e- Easily deployed: we provide a single, self-contained Docker image (\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot/pkgs/container/sourcebot\"\u003ehttps://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot/pkgs/container/so...\u003c/a\u003e).\u003cp\u003e- Fast \u0026 scalable: designed to minimize search times (current average is ~73ms) across many large repositories.\u003cp\u003e- Cross code-host support: we currently support syncing public \u0026 private repositories in GitHub and GitLab.\u003cp\u003e- Quality UI: we like to think that a good looking dev-tool is more pleasant to use.\u003cp\u003e- Open source: Sourcebot is free to use by anyone.\u003cp\u003eUnder the hood, we use Zoekt (\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/sourcegraph/zoekt\"\u003ehttps://github.com/sourcegraph/zoekt\u003c/a\u003e) as our code search engine, which was originally authored by Han-Wen Nienhuys and now maintained by Sourcegraph (\u003ca href=\"https://sourcegraph.com/blog/sourcegraph-accepting-zoekt-maintainership\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://sourcegraph.com/blog/sourcegraph-accepting-zoekt-mai...\u003c/a\u003e). Zoekt works by building a trigram index from the source code enabling extremely fast regular expression matching. Russ Cox has a great article on how trigram indexes work if you’re interested: \u003ca href=\"https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the shorter-term, there are several improvements we want to make, like:\u003cp\u003e- Improving how we communicate indexing progress (this is currently non-existent so it’s not obvious how long things will take)\u003cp\u003e- UX improvements like search history, query syntax highlighting \u0026 suggestions, etc.\u003cp\u003e- Small QOL improvements like bookmarking code snippets.\u003cp\u003e- Support for more code hosts (e.g., BitBucket, SourceForge, ADO, etc.)\u003cp\u003eIn the longer-term, we want to investigate how we could go beyond just traditional code search by leveraging machine learning to enable experiences like semantic code search (“where is system X located?”) and code explanations (”how does system X interact with system Y?”). You could think of this as a copilot being embedded into Sourcebot. Our hunch is that will be useful to devs, especially when packaged with the traditional code search, but let us know what you think.\u003cp\u003eGive it a try: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot\"\u003ehttps://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot\u003c/a\u003e.

We’ve been building AI video models for ‘digital twins’ or ‘avatars’ since 2020.\u003cp\u003eWe’re sharing some of the challenges we faced building an AI video interface that has realistic conversations with a human, including getting it to under 1 second of latency.\u003cp\u003eTo try it, talk to Hassaan’s digital twin: \u003ca href=\"https://www.hassaanraza.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.hassaanraza.com\u003c/a\u003e, or to our \"demo twin\" Carter: \u003ca href=\"https://www.tavus.io\"\u003ehttps://www.tavus.io\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe built this because until now, we've had to adapt communication to the limits of technology. But what if we could interact naturally with a computer? Conversational video makes it possible – we think it'll eventually be a key human-computer interface.\u003cp\u003eTo make conversational video effective, it has to have really low latency and conversational awareness. A fast-paced conversation between friends has ~250 ms between utterances, but if you’re talking about something more complex or with someone new, there is additional “thinking” time. So, less than 1000 ms latency makes the conversation feel pretty realistic, and that became our target.\u003cp\u003eOur architecture decisions had to balance 3 things: latency, scale, \u0026 cost. Getting all of these was a huge challenge.\u003cp\u003eThe first lesson learned was to make it low-latency, we had to build it from the ground up. We went from a team that cared about seconds to a team that counts every millisecond. We also had to support thousands of conversations happening all at once, without getting destroyed on compute costs.\u003cp\u003eFor example, during early development, each conversation had to run on an individual H100 in order to fit all components and model weights into GPU memory just to run our Phoenix-1 model faster than 30fps. This was unscalable \u0026 expensive.\u003cp\u003eWe developed a new model, Phoenix-2, with a number of improvements, including inference speed. We switched from a NeRF based backbone to  Gaussian Splatting for a multitude of reasons, one being the requirement that we could generate frames faster than realtime, at 70+ fps on lower-end hardware. \nWe exceeded this and focused on optimizing memory and core usage on GPU to allow for lower-end hardware to run it all. We did other things to save on time and cost like using streaming vs batching, parallelizing processes, etc. But those are stories for another day.\u003cp\u003eWe still had to lower the utterance-to-utterance time to hit our goal of under a second of latency. This meant each component (vision, ASR, LLM, TTS, video generation) had to be hyper-optimized.\u003cp\u003eThe worst offender was the LLM. It didn’t matter how fast the tokens per second (t/s) were, it was the time-to-first token (tfft) that really made the difference. That meant services like Groq were actually too slow – they had high t/s, but slow ttft. Most providers were too slow.\u003cp\u003eThe next worst offender was actually detecting when someone stopped speaking. This is  hard. Basic solutions use time after silence to ‘determine’ when someone has stopped talking. But it adds latency. If you tune it to be too short, the AI agent will talk over you. Too long, and it’ll take a while to respond. The model had to be dedicated to accurately detecting end-of-turn based on conversation signals, and speculating on inputs to get a head start.\u003cp\u003eWe went from 3-5 to \u003c1 second (\u0026 as fast as 600 ms) with these architectural optimizations while running on lower-end hardware.\u003cp\u003eAll this allowed us to ship with a less than 1 second of latency, which we believe is the fastest out there. We have a bunch of customers, including Delphi, a professional coach and expert cloning platform. They have users that have conversations with digital twins that span from minutes, to one hour, to even four hours (!) - which is mind blowing, even to us.\u003cp\u003eThanks for reading! let us know what you think and what you would build.
