Smartwatches don't really get old — the silicon is basically the same as it was a decade ago. We just keep making it useful for us.\u003cp\u003eNo usage stats, no tracking, no illusions of mass adoption. The only real signal we get is the occasional person who appears in our Matrix chat going \"hey, it booted on my watch from 2014 and now it's usable again\" — and that's plenty.\u003cp\u003ePrivacy is non-negotiable: zero telemetry, no cloud, full local control. Longevity is the other half: we refuse to let good hardware become e-waste just because support ended.\nOn the learning side, it's been one of the best playgrounds: instant feedback on your wrist makes QML/Qt, JavaScript watchfaces and embedded Linux feel tangible. The community is small and kind — perfect for people who want to learn open-source dev without gatekeeping.\u003cp\u003eTechnically we're still pragmatic: libhybris + older kernels on most devices since it just works, but we've already mainlined rinato (Samsung Gear 2) and sparrow (ASUS ZenWatch 2) — rinato even boots with a usable UI. That's the direction we're pushing toward.\u003cp\u003eRepo: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/AsteroidOS\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://github.com/AsteroidOS\u003c/a\u003e \nInstall images \u0026 docs: \u003ca href=\"https://asteroidos.org\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://asteroidos.org\u003c/a\u003e \n2.0 demo video : \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6FiQz0yACc\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6FiQz0yACc\u003c/a\u003e \nAnnouncement post: \u003ca href=\"https://asteroidos.org/news/2-0-release/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://asteroidos.org/news/2-0-release/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eQuestions, port requests, mentoring offers, criticism, weird ideas — all welcome.

HN: You helped save 33k lives","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003e13 years ago, we launched Watsi.org with a Show HN [1].\u003cp\u003eFor nearly a year, this community drove so much traffic that we couldn’t list patients fast enough. Then pg saw us on HN, wrote us our first big check, and accepted us as the first YC nonprofit (W13). The next few years were a whirlwind.\u003cp\u003eI was a young, naive founder with just enough experience to know I wanted Watsi to be more efficient, transparent, and innovative than most nonprofits. We spent 24/7 talking to users and coding. We did things that don’t scale. We tried our best to be walking, talking pg essays.\u003cp\u003eOver the years we learned that product/market fit is different for nonprofits. Not many people wake up and think, \"I'd love to donate to a nonprofit today\" with the same oomph that they think, \"I'd love a coffee\" or \"I'd like to make more money.\"\u003cp\u003eNo matter how much effort we put into fundraising, donations grew linearly, while requests for care grew exponentially. I felt caught in the middle. After investing everything I had, I eventually burned out and transitioned to the board.\u003cp\u003eI made a classic founder mistake and intertwined my self-worth with Watsi's success. I believed that if I could somehow help every patient, I was a good person, but if I let down some patients, which became inevitable, I was a bad person.\u003cp\u003eThis was exacerbated by seeing our for-profit YC batch mates raise massive rounds. I felt like a failure for not scaling Watsi faster, but eventually we accepted reality and set Watsi on more of a slow, steady, and sustainable trajectory.\u003cp\u003eNow that I have perspective, I'm incredibly proud of what the org has accomplished and grateful to everyone who has done a tour of duty to support us. Watsi donors have donated over $20M to fund 33,241 surgeries, and we have a good shot of helping patients for a long time to come.\u003cp\u003eIn a world of fast growth and fast crashes, here's a huge thank you to the HN users who have stuck by Watsi, or any other important cause, even when it's not on the front page. I believe it embodies the best of humanity.

So I set about writing one, and some five years later I'm happy \nto share the result. I think it's one of the few \"computer history\" books that has tons of code, but correct me if I'm wrong (I wrote this both to tell a story and to learn :-)).\u003cp\u003eMy favorite languages are Smalltalk and Lisp, but as an Emacs user, I've been \nusing the latter for much longer and for my current projects, Common Lisp is a better fit, so I call myself \"a Lisp-er\" these days.
