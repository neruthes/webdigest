HN: Godspeed is a fast, 100% keyboard oriented todo app for Mac","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHi everybody, today I'm launching version 1.0 of Godspeed, a todo manager built with two priorities in mind: speed and 100% keyboard orientation. Every action in Godspeed can be done from your keyboard and will respond instantly. It's like Superhuman for your todo list.\u003cp\u003eGodspeed has everything you expect in a todo manager like shared lists, labels, smart lists, boolean search operators, and cloud sync. If you're already a user of an app like Todoist or OmniFocus you should be able find everything you need in Godspeed.\u003cp\u003eI think the most appealing thing to most HN users would be the keyboard orientation. Literally every single action in Godspeed is doable from your keyboard. I'm so serious about this that I built \"hardcore mode\" to completely disable the mouse - this both helps you break the habit of reaching for your mouse, and keeps us honest about 100% hotkey support.\u003cp\u003eYou can fully customize the hotkeys, but if you're into Vim or Emacs you'll feel right at home by default.\u003cp\u003eWe've got a 2 week free trial with no limitations, and then offer subscription or one-time purchase options.\u003cp\u003eThanks for checking out Godspeed, I'd love to hear your feedback!\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://godspeedapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://godspeedapp.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39756325\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39756325\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 218\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 154\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://godspeedapp.com/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39756325","date_published":"2024-03-19T14:53:51Z","author":{"name":"DanielDe","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=DanielDe"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39755927","title":"Launch HN: Okapi (YC W24) – A new, flexible CRM with good UX","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHi HN!\u003cp\u003eWe’re Ulysse and Ned from Okapi. We’re making a modern CRM. It's kind of like if Airtable/Notion built Salesforce today. \u003ca href=\"https://okapicrm.com\"\u003ehttps://okapicrm.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I was fresh out of college, working for startups, Salesforce was this big mystery to me. It's the perpetual second screen for everyone in sales. They were building this gigantic obelisk downtown. What was this thing? And why did every salesperson I knew seem to live in it all day, and yet hate it so much?\u003cp\u003eTurns out Salesforce is basically PhpMyAdmin for salespeople. It's just basically two things:\u003cp\u003e1. A really generic database, and a UI for CRUDing your data.\u003cp\u003e2. An API and ecosystem of integrations.\u003cp\u003eIn other words, it's the back-office CRUD app to end all back-office CRUD apps. People call the result a \"CRM\" (Customer Relationship Management).\u003cp\u003eSalesforce is slow and clunky. And that doesn’t matter because people don’t buy Salesforce to be delighted. They buy Salesforce to avoid being screwed over.\u003cp\u003eSObjects are how Salesforce does that. It’s the best idea Salesforce ever had: make everything in your product be built upon a generic data layer that your users can configure. Just like how you can add a new sheet or column in a spreadsheet, in Salesforce you can add new objects and fields. You can CRUD, report on, and do automations on top of custom data in exactly the same way you do it for built-in data.\u003cp\u003eThe graveyard of wannabe Salesforces is littered with people who forgot about this key insight.\u003cp\u003eWe think the way you win in CRM in 2024 is by keeping the flexibility of SObjects, and then tacking on modern UX. That first part takes engineering discipline, but the second part is much easier than Salesforce had it 25 years ago. Just about every part of a modern SaaS product has dozens of vendors that do most of the work for you.\u003cp\u003eWe're really excited to get feedback from HN on what we have. Here’s a video demo: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uRBf_9CRyM\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uRBf_9CRyM\u003c/a\u003e - and you can try it yourself:\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://app.okapicrm.com\"\u003ehttps://app.okapicrm.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eEmail: hn.login.user@okapicrm.com\u003cp\u003ePassword: sk9ueEAfhXP9j4cuxLCVmw7.\u003cp\u003eYou can test out our email integration, send an email to: hn.demo@okapicrm.com\u003cp\u003eAnd see that email (up to ~10min latency): \u003ca href=\"https://app.okapicrm.com/objects/emails/records\"\u003ehttps://app.okapicrm.com/objects/emails/records\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’re very eager for your honest feedback. What do you think we're missing? One thing we can’t decide if it’s a need-to-have is Apex -- is having in-transaction custom scripting really necessary for a CRM? Or is that just something they tacked on as Salesforce became more of an app platform and less of a focused CRM product?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca
