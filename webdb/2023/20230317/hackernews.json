Think Google Sheets or Airtable, but on your relational database. We provide a collaborative UI on top of Postgres, MySQL and other databases, enabling teams to view, edit and visualize their data.  Here’s our short demo video: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38RslBYdZnk\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38RslBYdZnk\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccessing data is a challenge to team members who aren’t data analysts or engineers. Databases are usually locked down to a few team members, and everybody else has to rely on them to get access. Most non-engineers can’t (and don't want to) use developer tools, and developers don't want to write SQL for teammates all day. Technical employees end up being bottlenecks for access to data. In some cases this can be extreme—we’ve seen publicly traded companies with only 2 data scientists for the whole org!\u003cp\u003eOur goal is to make data accessible to everyone who needs it. We have an intuitive spreadsheet-like editor that sits on top of your databases, as well as the capability to save and share queries. You can take those queries to create charts and dashboards for your team. You can also query your data using EZQL, our natural-language-to-SQL conversion. We use OpenAI to power the natural language process, and we pass the relational schema on top so we can easily know the relationships between your tables.\u003cp\u003ePrior to starting Outerbase, I (Brandon) was a product designer at DigitalOcean and noticed that while DO did a good job making it simple to create databases, there wasn't a modern solution to manage them afterwards. Often users had to use PHPMyAdmin, psql, or $insertDBGUIHere, and to be honest most of them do not provide the best user experience. They’re for a very technical audience, and fall short of making data accessible for everyone. We saw a need to do for data what DigitalOcean did with the droplet.\u003cp\u003eBrayden led an engineering team at Walmart and dealt with data at a completely different scale. He led the iOS, Android, and web teams for their amends experience and a lot of time was spent pulling, querying, and generating reports on that data. So when we talked about building this he was immediately in.\u003cp\u003eHow it works: We have a React-based frontend that uses a combination of Sequelize and some native libraries to normalize the underlying SQL, which allows us to query and connect to different relational databases. Currently we support Postgres, MySQL, Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift. We don't store any of your end data—everything else is encrypted and all credentials are stored in KMS.\u003cp\u003eTools like Outerbase make it possible for people to do their jobs more directly. One of our larger customers uses us as a way to moderate what gets posted to their app. Users submit data and our customer will actually go in and mark a column approved if the content is ok for their audience.\u003cp\u003eOuterbase is available to use today. You can try it for free with 1 user and then if you want to collaborate or use additional features you can upgrade to our pro tier or the obligatory “call us” enterprise tier.\u003cp\u003eWe would love to hear your thoughts on the product, you can sign up today for free, use the sandbox database or connect your own! We know the space isn’t exactly uncrowded, but we hope our approach to building something that is intuitive and collaborative will make it easier for everyone to access their data. We know some HN users are not our target audience because they’re technical and already have tools they’re comfortable with—but even then you might want a tool so your team doesn’t have to bug you as much with data requests! We let you simply give them read access to their db and enable them to do their own queries.\u003cp\u003eWe’d love to hear your views, opinions, experiences about this. What would you want to see from a database/data visualization tool? Looking forward to discussion in the comments!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca

You can join our public Slack where you can ask Sidekick questions about Airbyte, a popular open source data connector catalog:\n\u003ca href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/sidekick-public/shared_invite/zt-1ra86qug3-~UWNCISLWpNj55Im6C6OaQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://join.slack.com/t/sidekick-public/shared_invite/zt-1r...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eOr if you prefer to not sign up to our Slack, here's a demo video showing the same thing: \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/fPhP1325RkI\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/fPhP1325RkI\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’re in the process of making everything open source (there are some contractual issues we’re working through), but our client side code and basic infra is here: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/ai-sidekick/sidekick\"\u003ehttps://github.com/ai-sidekick/sidekick\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cp\u003eProviding technical support to developers has been expensive for companies because they need to hire skilled engineers to do it. We’ve seen community support channels with a 2000:1 ratio of developers to support engineers - there’s no way every question will get answered. We built Sidekick to make this much easier. It’s particularly helpful for open-source companies/projects because many OSS communities have a lot of people asking questions, but hardly anyone helping troubleshoot.\u003cp\u003eWe integrate with Slack and Discord, since that’s where developer support is already happening. On the backend, we use Weaviate to index the data and OpenAI’s text-davinci-3 model to generate responses.\u003cp\u003eIn addition to answering questions, Sidekick can also update .md files automatically with new information. When someone reacts to a message in Slack with the emoji, Sidekick will use Weaviate to find the part in your documentation that’s most related to the message, then use GPT3 to merge the new info into the documentation. Finally, it will submit a pull request on Github with the changes. We saw that devrel teams are already making product announcements and helping users troubleshoot common issues in the community, so we built this feature to save them even more time.\u003cp\u003eWe use GPT for generating the responses and new documentation, but are relying less and less on it after learning that you hit a ceiling on answer quality very quickly by using only GPT and prompt engineering techniques. Here’s some of what we learned trying to prevent hallucinations in our answers: \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@jfan001/how-we-cut-the-rate-of-gpt-hallucinations-from-20-to-less-than-2-f3bfcc10e4ec\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://medium.com/@jfan001/how-we-cut-the-rate-of-gpt-hallu...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat we found makes a much bigger difference is the breadth and quality of the content you can search through, which is why we now rely a lot more on cleaning and annotating data, which yields far better results when combined with prompt chaining. For example, instead of naively chunking data into 1000 token blocks, we parse the markdown into semantically meaningful sections (e.g. paragraphs, lists, code blocks) and tag the content with the header name and document name so it’s more likely to surface for searches that are match for the section it’s from, even if it doesn’t exactly match the content in that chunk.\u003cp\u003eOne fun thing we also learned is that when Sidekick gets added to a #help channel, people who otherwise wouldn’t ask questions start using it. It turns out, there are a lot of “lurkers” who come to these channels to find answers, but don’t want to bother anyone with their issue. Adding a tool that they can get answers from instantly brings these people out into the community, giving founders and community managers an opportunity to reach out to them.\u003cp\u003eTo summarize, Sidekick 1) saves support engineers time, 2) keeps the docs up to date and 3) helps engage developers in the community. Long-term we want to provide an analytics product on top of Sidekick so companies can understand how their product is being used and where there are opportunities to add more value to their customers (and charge more money for it).\u003cp\u003eWe’d love to hear from the HN community about this product! Do you think using a tool to search through and update developer docs from Slack would save you time?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35184120\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35184120\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 113\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 71\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35184120","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35184120","date_published":"2023-03-16T16:21:21Z","author":{"name":"jasonwcfan","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jasonwcfan"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35184011","title":"Twitch CEO Emmett Shear is resigning","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/16/23643223/twitch-ceo-emmett-shear-resigning-dan-clancy\"\u003ehttps://www.theverge.com/2023/3/16/23643223/twitch-ceo-emmett-shear-resigning-dan-clancy\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35184011\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35184011\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 197\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 229\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/16/23643223/twitch-ceo-emmett-shear-resigning-dan-clancy","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35184011","date_published":"2023-03-16T16:15:59Z","author":{"name":"ExMachina73","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ExMachina73"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35183407","title":"Virgin Orbit pauses all operations","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/virgin-orbit-pauses-all-operations/\"\u003ehttps://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/virgin-orbit-pauses-all-operations/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35183407\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35183407\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 107\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 81\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/virgin-orbit-pauses-all-operations/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35183407","date_published":"2023-03-16T15:42:14Z","author":{"name":"Brajeshwar","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Brajeshwar"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35183317","title":"Show HN: Quality News – Towards a fairer ranking algorithm for Hacker News","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHello HN!\u003cp\u003eTLDR;\u003cp\u003e- Quality News is a Hacker News client that provides additional data and insights on submissions, notably, the upvoteRate metric.\u003cp\u003e- We propose that this metric could be used to improve the Hacker News ranking score.\u003cp\u003e- In-depth explanation: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/social-protocols/news#readme\"\u003ehttps://github.com/social-protocols/news#readme\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Hacker News ranking score is directly proportional to upvotes, which is a problem because it creates a feedback loop: higher rank leads to more upvotes leads to higher rank, and so on...\u003cp\u003e\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e                →\n             ↗     ↘\n    Higher Rank   More Upvotes\n             ↖     ↙\n                ←\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\nAs a consequence, success on HN depends almost entirely on getting enough upvotes in the first hour or so to make the front page and get caught in this feedback loop. And getting these early upvotes is largely a matter of timing, luck, and moderator decisions. And so the best stories don't always make the front page, and the stories on the front page are not always the best.\u003cp\u003eOur proposed solution is to use upvoteRate instead of upvotes in the ranking formula. upvoteRate is an estimate of how much more or less likely users are to upvote a story compared to the average story, taking account how much attention the story as received, based on a history of the ranks and times at which it has been shown. You can read about how we calculate this metric in more detail here: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/social-protocols/news#readme\"\u003ehttps://github.com/social-protocols/news#readme\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbout 1.5 years ago, we published an article with this basic idea of counteracting the rank-upvotes feedback loop by using attention as negative feedback. We received very valuable input from the HN community (\u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28391659\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28391659\u003c/a\u003e). Quality News has been created based largely on this feedback.\u003cp\u003eCurrently, Quality News shows the upvoteRate metric for live Hacker News data, as well as charts of the rank and upvote history of each story. We have not yet implemented an alternative ranking algorithm, because we don't have access to data on flags and moderator actions, which are a major component of the HN ranking score.\u003cp\u003eWe'd love to see the Hacker News team experiment with the new formula, perhaps on an alternative front page. This will allow the community to evaluate whether the new ranking formula is an improvement over the current one.\u003cp\u003eWe look forward discussing our approach with you!\u003cp\u003eLinks:\u003cp\u003eSite: \u003ca href=\"https://news.social-protocols.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://news.social-protocols.org/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eReadme: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/social-protocols/news#readme\"\u003ehttps://github.com/social-protocols/news#readme\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrevious Blog Post: \u003ca href=\"https://felx.me/2021/08/29/improving-the-hacker-news-ranking-algorithm.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://felx.me/2021/08/29/improving-the-hacker-news-ranking...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrevious Discussion: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28391659\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28391659\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35183317\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35183317\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 118\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 61\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://news.social-protocols.org/top","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35183317","date_published":"2023-03-16T15:37:09Z","author":{"name":"manx","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=manx"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35183073","title":"John Deere's ongoing GPL violations: What's next","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2023/mar/16/john-deere-gpl-violations/\"\u003ehttps://sfconservancy.org/blog/2023/mar/16/john-deere-gpl-violations/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35183073\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35183073\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 314\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 73\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2023/mar/16/john-deere-gpl-violations/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35183073","date_published":"2023-03-16T15:17:34Z","author":{"name":"pabs3","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pabs3"}}]}
