We've since reproduced the issue with several other companies' signup flows.\u003cp\u003eWhat's the issue?\u003cp\u003eA few months ago we (Flat.app) noticed that a meaningful fraction of signups-via-Google to our SaaS product were failing. I recently found out why, so I'm sharing this PSA for anyone facing a similar problem.\u003cp\u003eIf your app supports \"Sign in with Google\", it's likely that new signups will fail if, on Google's OAuth consent screen, a user clicks \"Continue\" more than once. The error will probably be inscrutable to the user, depending on your setup, so they may just give up instead of trying again. In our case, we were losing around 15% of signups!\u003cp\u003eI encountered this issue while investigating failed signups for our product, but I've also reproduced it with other popular products including ChatGPT, Doordash, Expedia, and Snyk, so I assume it's widespread.\u003cp\u003eSome of these products use Auth0, as do we, but others don't, and they still generate an error of one kind or another.\u003cp\u003eFor Auth0 specifically, the error is \"You may have pressed the back button, refreshed during login, opened too many login dialogs, or there is some issue with cookies, since we couldn't find your session. Try logging in again from the application and if the problem persists please contact the administrator.\" The error tries to be helpful by listing potential causes, but it fails to mention the actual cause. That's because Auth0 wasn't aware of this failure mode, based on my correspondence with them.\u003cp\u003eWhy does this happen?\u003cp\u003eAfter a user clicks \"Continue\" the first time, Google will respond with a 302 to the callback URL, passing along the authorization code and replaying the OAuth 2.0 state param. If the user clicks \"Continue\" again, Google will respond again with a 302 to the callback URL. The browser will abort the first pending request and issue a new request to the callback URL. Importantly, the state param is, as it should be, the same in both requests, and it typically incorporates a nonce (see https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics#name-protecting-redirect-based-f). Since the nonce will already have been consumed by the first request, the second request will be rejected.\u003cp\u003eWhy would a user click \"Continue\" twice?\u003cp\u003eSimple: poor UX in Google's consent screen. The \"Continue\" button provides almost no feedback that the click was registered, and the screen provides no feedback that any requests are pending. So, some users will naturally try again, especially if they're on a slow connection.\u003cp\u003eWhat can Google do?\u003cp\u003eGoogle could disable the \"Continue\" button with a loading indicator after the first click. That would ensure it's not possible to click it twice, and it would provide an improved UX by showing the user that something is happening.\u003cp\u003eGoogle's OAuth consent screen was redesigned at some point in the past few years. Allowing \"Continue\" to be clicked twice, with no visible feedback, may be an unintended regression.\u003cp\u003eWhat can I do?\u003cp\u003eTest this in your own application. Be sure to deauthorize your app before each test run so that you get the OAuth consent screen. You can do that in your Google account's Data \u0026 privacy section.\u003cp\u003eAlso, check your logs for errors to see if you're losing signups. See if you can detect this scenario and, if so, provide a better experience to users, e.g., by acknowledging what caused the error and giving them a clearer path to continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41236745\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41236745\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 147\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 51\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41236745","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41236745","date_published":"2024-08-13T16:05:33Z","author":{"name":"Aalk4308","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Aalk4308"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41236430","title":"From object transition to RCE in the Chrome renderer","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/from-object-transition-to-rce-in-the-chrome-renderer/\"\u003ehttps://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/from-object-transition-to-rce-in-the-chrome-renderer/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41236430\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41236430\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 132\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 17\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/from-object-transition-to-rce-in-the-chrome-renderer/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41236430","date_published":"2024-08-13T15:31:45Z","author":{"name":"mikece","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mikece"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41236275","title":"You've got to hide your myopia away: John Lennon's contact lenses","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/opo.13351\"\u003ehttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/opo.13351\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41236275\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41236275\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 110\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 112\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/opo.13351","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41236275","date_published":"2024-08-13T15:14:54Z","author":{"name":"geox","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=geox"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41236273","title":"Launch HN: Trellis (YC W24) – AI-powered workflows for unstructured data","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHey HN —  We're Jacky and Mac from Trellis (\u003ca href=\"https://runtrellis.com/\"\u003ehttps://runtrellis.com/\u003c/a\u003e). We’re building AI-powered ETL for unstructured data. Trellis transforms phone calls, PDFs, and chats into structured SQL format based on any schema you define in natural language. This helps data and ops teams automate manual data entry and run SQL queries on messy data.\u003cp\u003eThere’s a demo video at \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib3mRh2tnSo\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib3mRh2tnSo\u003c/a\u003e and a sandbox to try out (no sign-in required!) at \u003ca href=\"https://demo.runtrellis.com/\"\u003ehttps://demo.runtrellis.com/\u003c/a\u003e.  An interesting historical archive of unstructured data we thought it would be interesting to run Trellis on top of are old Enron emails which famously took months to review. We’ve created a showcase demo here: \u003ca href=\"https://demo.runtrellis.com/showcase/enron-email-analysis\"\u003ehttps://demo.runtrellis.com/showcase/enron-email-analysis\u003c/a\u003e, with some documentation here: \u003ca href=\"https://docs.runtrellis.com/docs/example-email-analytics\"\u003ehttps://docs.runtrellis.com/docs/example-email-analytics\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cp\u003eWhy we built this: At the Stanford AI lab where we met, we collaborated with many F500 data teams (including Amazon, Meta, and Standard Chartered), and repeatedly saw the same problem: 80% of enterprise data is unstructured, and traditional platforms can’t handle it. For example, a major commercial bank I work with couldn’t improve credit risk models because critical data was stuck in PDFs and emails.\u003cp\u003eWe realized that our research from the AI lab could be turned into a solution with an abstraction layer that works as well for financial underwriting as it does for analysis of call center transcripts: an AI-powered ETL that takes in any unstructured data source and turns it into a schematically correct table.\u003cp\u003eSome interesting technical challenges we had to tackle along the way: (1) Supporting complex documents out of the box: We use LLM-based map-reduce to handle long documents and vision models for table and layout extraction. (2) Model Routing: We select the best model for each transformation to optimize cost and speed. For instance, in data extraction tasks, we could leverage simpler fine-tuned models that are specialized in returning structured JSONs of financial tables. (3) Data Validation and Schema Guarantees: We ensure accuracy with reference links and anomaly detection.\u003cp\u003eAfter launching Trellis, we’ve seen diverse use cases, especially in legacy industries where PDFs are treated as APIs. For example, financial services companies need to process complex documents like bonds and credit ratings into a structured format, and need to speed up underwriting and enable pass-through loan processing. Customer support and back-office operations need to accelerate onboarding by mapping documents across different schema and ERP systems, and ensure support agents follow SOPs (security questions, compliance disclosures, etc.). And many companies today want data preprocessing in ETL pipelines and data ingestion for RAG.\u003cp\u003eWe’d love your feedback!
