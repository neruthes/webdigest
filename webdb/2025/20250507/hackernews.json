We’re Will and Jeff from Exa (\u003ca href=\"https://exa.ai\"\u003ehttps://exa.ai\u003c/a\u003e). We recently launched Exa Websets, an embeddings-powered search engine designed to return exactly what you’re asking for. You can get precise results for complex queries like “all startups working on open-source developer tools based in SF, founded 2021-2025”. \nDemo here - \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/Unt8hJmCxd4\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/Unt8hJmCxd4\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe started working on Exa because we were frustrated that while LLM state-of-the-art is advancing every week, Google has gotten worse over time. The Internet used to feel like a magical information portal, but it doesn’t feel that way anymore when you’re constantly being pushed towards SEO-optimized clickbait.\u003cp\u003eWebsets is a step in the opposite direction. For every search, we perform dozens of embedding searches over Exa’s vector database of the web to find good search candidates, then we run agentic workflows on each result to verify they match exactly what you asked for.\u003cp\u003eWebsets results are good for two reasons. First, we train custom embedding models for our main search algorithm, instead of typical keyword matching search algorithms. Our embeddings models are trained specifically to return exactly the type of entity you ask for. In practice, that means if you search “startups working in nanotech”, keyword-based search engines return listicles about nanotech startups, because these listicles match the keywords in the query. In contrast, our embedding models return actual startup homepages, because these startup homepages match the meaning of the query.\u003cp\u003eThe second is that LLMs provide the last-mile intelligence needed to verify every result. Each result and piece of data is backed with supporting references that we used to validate that the result is actually a match for your search criteria. That’s why Websets can take minutes or even hours to run, depending on your query and how many results you ask for. For valuable search queries, we think this is worth it.\u003cp\u003eAlso notably, Websets are tables, not lists. You can add “enrichment” columns to find more information about each result, like “# of employees” or “does author have blog?”, and the cells asynchronously load in. This table format hopefully makes the web feel more like a database.\u003cp\u003eA few examples of searches that work with Websets:\u003cp\u003e- “Math blogs created by teachers from outside the US”: \u003ca href=\"https://websets.exa.ai/cma1oz9xf007sis0ipzxgbamn\"\u003ehttps://websets.exa.ai/cma1oz9xf007sis0ipzxgbamn\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003e- \"research paper about ways to avoid the O(n^2) attention problem in transformers, where one of the first author's first name starts with \"A\",\"B\", \"S\", or \"T\", and it was written between 2018 and 2022”: \u003ca href=\"https://websets.exa.ai/cm7dpml8c001ylnymum4sp11h\"\u003ehttps://websets.exa.ai/cm7dpml8c001ylnymum4sp11h\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003e- “US based healthcare companies, with over 100 employees and a technical founder\": \u003ca href=\"https://websets.exa.ai/cm6lc0dlk004ilecmzej76qx2\"\u003ehttps://websets.exa.ai/cm6lc0dlk004ilecmzej76qx2\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003e- “all software engineers in the Bay Area, with experience in startups, who know Rust and have published technical content before”: \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/knjrlm1aibQ\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/knjrlm1aibQ\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can try it at \u003ca href=\"https://websets.exa.ai/\"\u003ehttps://websets.exa.ai/\u003c/a\u003e and API docs are at \u003ca href=\"https://docs.exa.ai/websets\"\u003ehttps://docs.exa.ai/websets\u003c/a\u003e.

My video was on the front page on Friday: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43876243\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43876243\u003c/a\u003e, but dang said we should do a Show HN as well, so here goes!\u003cp\u003eI’ve wanted to put sheet music into smart glasses for a long time, but the perfect opportunity to execute came in mid-February, when Mentra (YC W25) tweeted about a smart glasses hackathon they were hosting - winners would get to take home a pair. I went, had a blast making a bunch of music-related apps with my teammate, and we won, so I got to take them home, refine the project, and make a pretty cool video about it (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j36u2i7PKKE\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j36u2i7PKKE\u003c/a\u003e).\u003cp\u003eThe glasses are Even Realities G1s. They look normal, but they have two microphones, a screen in each lens, and can be even made with a prescription. Every person I’ve met who tried them on was surprised at how good the display is, and the video recordings of them unfortunately don’t do them justice.\u003cp\u003eThe software runs on AugmentOS, which is Mentra’s smart glasses operating system that works on various 3rd-party smart glasses, including the G1s. All I had to do to make an app was write and run a typescript file using the AugmentOS SDK. This gives you the voice transcription and raw audio as input, and text or bitmaps available as output to the screens, everything else is completely abstracted away. Your glasses communicate with an AugmentOS app, and then the app communicates with your typescript service.\u003cp\u003eThe only hard part was creating a Python script to turn sheet music (MusicXML format) into small, optimized bitmaps to display on the screens. To start, the existing landscape of music-related Python libraries is pretty poorly documented and I ran into multiple never-before-seen error messages. Downscaling to the small size of the glasses screens also meant that stems and staff lines were disappearing, so I thought to use morphological dilation to emphasize those without making the notes unintelligible.  The final pipeline was MusicXML -\u003e music21 library to render chunks of bars to png -\u003e dilate with opencv- \u003e downscale -\u003e convert to bitmap with Pillow -\u003e optimize bitmaps with imagemagick. This is far from the best code I’ve ever written, but the LLMs attempt at this whole task was abysmal and my years of Python experience really got to shine here. The code is on GitHub: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/kevinlinxc/AugmentedChords\"\u003ehttps://github.com/kevinlinxc/AugmentedChords\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cp\u003ePutting it together, my typescript service serves these bitmaps locally when requested. I put together a UI where I can navigate menus and sheet music with voice commands (e.g. show catalog, next, select, start, exit, pause) and then I connected foot pedals to my laptop. Because of bitmap sending latency (~3s right now, but future glasses will do better), using foot pedals to turn the bars while playing wasn’t viable, so I instead had one of my pedals toggle autoscrolling, and the other two pedals sped up/temporarily paused the scrolling.\u003cp\u003eAfter lots of adjustments, I was able to play a full song using just the glasses! It took many takes and there was definitely lots of room for improvement. For example: - Bitmap sending is pretty slow, which is why using the foot pedals to turn bars wasn’t viable. - The resolution is pretty small, I would love to put more bars in at once so I can flip less frequently. - Since foot pedals aren’t portable, it would be cool to have a mode where the audio dictates when the sheet music changes. I tried implementing that with FFT but it was often wrong and more effort is needed. Head tilt controls would be cool too, because full manual control is a hard requirement for practicing.\u003cp\u003eAll of these pain points are being targeted by Mentra and other companies competing in the space, and so I’m super excited to see the next generation! Also, feel free to ask me anything!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca
