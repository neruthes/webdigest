My team and I built this. I hope you like the themes we’ve built so far, and maybe even get inspired to build your own.\u003cp\u003eI know Web Components are in a bit of a drama cycle right now. I’m happy to see them get any attention really. I’ve been pretty bullish on them since ~2013 when I started working with them, at least in the context of a \u003ci\u003ewidget\u003c/i\u003e like a video player. I’ve even given many related talks on them like this one (\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6Mh84SRoDg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6Mh84SRoDg\u003c/a\u003e).\u003cp\u003eI would never push them for a large app or as a full replacement for React, but they’ve been incredible for making video players that are compatible across many contexts, and Player.style is a clear demonstration of that when you get to the step of embedding a theme. Web components really shine for building bits of UI that can be shared between projects. They also are the best way to avoid the long term JS framework thrash that’s a challenge for any developer who works on the web for long enough. One of the best decisions I ever made for Video.js was to \u003ci\u003enot\u003c/i\u003e build it with jQuery. Video.js is 15 years old now and still in use, while all the jQuery players are not.\u003cp\u003eFor some added context of this project, when I was building Video.js back in 2010 I put a lot of thought into how other developers would customize the player controls. I was excited to use web technologies (instead of Flash) to build a player and I \u003ci\u003eknew\u003c/i\u003e other web devs would be too.\u003cp\u003eFast forward 14 years — Video.js has been used on millions of websites including Twitter, Instagram, Amazon, Dropbox, Linkedin and even in United Airlines headrests. In 99.99% of those cases the default Video.js controls were used with little to no customization. So…huge adoption success, utter failure in sparking creativity. In retrospect, asking people to learn a new UI framework just to style their player was too much.\u003cp\u003eMedia Chrome and Player.style are my answer to that friction.\u003cp\u003e- Media Chrome - A suite of Web Components and React Components that let you easily build a media player UI from scratch, using components you’re already familiar with.\u003cp\u003e- Player.stye - Themes built with Media Chrome, showing the cross-player and cross-framework flexibility of Media Chrome\u003cp\u003eMedia Chrome is already used on sites like TED.com, Syntax.fm, and anywhere the Mux Player is used. We’ve spent the last few months building some great themes for Player.style. I probably had the most fun recreating the Youtube icon animations from scratch using SVGs and CSS. (Whoever made the originals, nicely done!)\u003cp\u003eIt’s all free and open source, so don’t hesitate to jump in if you’re interested in the project. And of course I’m happy to answer any questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41780297\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41780297\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 136\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 32\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://player.style","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41780297","date_published":"2024-10-08T18:27:46Z","author":{"name":"Heff","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Heff"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41779519","title":"My first game with Carimbo, my homemade engine","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eArticle URL: \u003ca href=\"https://nullonerror.org/2024/10/08/my-first-game-with-carimbo/\"\u003ehttps://nullonerror.org/2024/10/08/my-first-game-with-carimbo/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41779519\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41779519\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 163\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 85\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://nullonerror.org/2024/10/08/my-first-game-with-carimbo/","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41779519","date_published":"2024-10-08T17:13:16Z","author":{"name":"delduca","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=delduca"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41776878","title":"Show HN: Kotlin Money","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eManipulating monetary amounts is a common computing chore.
