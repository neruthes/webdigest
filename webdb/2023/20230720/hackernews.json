Somebody said: \"one day, someone will do better\". That stuck and today we're trying to be that “someone” with my co-founders Thomas (design) and Charles (eng like me). Our company is called Twenty and our repo is here: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty\"\u003ehttps://github.com/twentyhq/twenty\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe want to fix two issues: most CRMs aren't enjoyable to use and they often clash with engineering teams.\u003cp\u003eYC encouraged us to launch early. What you see now is about two months' worth of feature development. Our tool only does a small part of what big CRM players offer, but we focused on providing a great user experience on the basics, instead of spreading ourselves thin across a vast range of features and delivering them half-heartedly. Plus, we've found that many small companies like the product as it is because they don't need all the complex stuff.\u003cp\u003eOnce we have covered the basics, we’ll soon be working on three big features: - Moving to a robust metadata-driven architecture; - Providing innovating ways to extend the CRM with Typescript; - Making it easy to connect data sources, and fetch data in real-time like in BI tools.\u003cp\u003eThe startup world is littered with ghosts of so-called \"Salesforce killers\", so we know it sounds naive to pitch ourselves in a similar way. But we think that if someone ends up changing this market, it will most likely be through a community-led effort. And there hasn’t really been any serious attempt to start a great new open source CRM in the last decade.\u003cp\u003eTwenty is built with Typescript, React, and NestJS with GraphQL, and licensed under AGPL. We plan to make money by offering a hosted version. Our docs are here: \u003ca href=\"https://docs.twenty.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"\u003ehttps://docs.twenty.com\u003c/a\u003e. Try on cloud: \u003ca href=\"https://app.twenty.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"\u003ehttps://app.twenty.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cp\u003eDev setup and demo: \u003ca href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/7b20b44d8d5146fea8923183511bb818\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"\u003ehttps://www.loom.com/share/7b20b44d8d5146fea8923183511bb818\u003c/a\u003e (Loom said they couldn’t provide a transcript because they don’t support “language other than english” haha... apologies in advance!)\u003cp\u003eWe’re very eager to get your feedback as we haven’t launched anywhere before this post. What's your CRM story? What should we prioritize next?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca

HN: Infisical – open-source secret management platform","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHi HN, we’re the founders of Infisical, the open source secret management platform – it provides an end-to-end set of tools to manage your secrets across your team and infrastructure (\u003ca href=\"https://infisical.com/\"\u003ehttps://infisical.com/\u003c/a\u003e).\u003cp\u003eExcited to show you all the progress that we’ve made in the past few months after our Launch HN in February (\u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34955699\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34955699\u003c/a\u003e) and Show HN in December (\u003ca

feedback which helped us improve Infisical. We’ve since released:\u003cp\u003e- Secret scanning: a new toolset to block commits with hardcoded secrets and continuously monitor your code.\u003cp\u003e- Folders: Deeper organizational structure within projects to accommodate for microservice architectures and storage of more secret types like user API keys and OAuth tokens.\u003cp\u003e- Node and Python SDKs, Webhooks: More ways to integrate and start syncing secrets with Infisical across your infrastructure.\u003cp\u003e- Integrations with Terraform, Supabase, Railway, Checkly, Cloudflare Pages, Azure Key Vault, Laravel Forge, and more.\u003cp\u003e- Secret Referencing and Importing: to create a proper single source of truth.\u003cp\u003e- 1-click deployments to AWS EC2, Digital Ocean, Render, Fly.io: More ways to self-host Infisical on your own infrastructure.\u003cp\u003eIn addition, the platform has become more stable and undergone a full-coverage penetration test; we’ve also begun the SOC 2 (Type II) certification process.\u003cp\u003eOverall, we’re really lucky to have support of the developer community, and, in fact, Infisical has gathered over 7k GitHub stars, and now processes over 200 million secrets per month for everyone from solo developers to public enterprises.\u003cp\u003eOur repo is published under the MIT license so any developer can use Infisical. Again, the goal is to not charge individual developers. We make money by charging a license fee for some enterprise features as well as providing a hosted version and support.\u003cp\u003eCheck out Infisical Cloud (\u003ca href=\"https://infisical.com/\"\u003ehttps://infisical.com/\u003c/a\u003e) or self-host Infisical on your own infrastructure (\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Infisical/infisical\"\u003ehttps://github.com/Infisical/infisical\u003c/a\u003e). We’d love to hear what you think!\u003cp\u003eWe’re excited to continue building Infisical, and keep shipping features for you.
