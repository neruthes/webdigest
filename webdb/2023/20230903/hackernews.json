Just hours before my account was banned I posted a list of ASNs (basically ISPs) connected to a non-discord server I had that looked like this:\u003cp\u003e22773  ASN-CXA-ALL-CCI-22773-RDC, US\u003cp\u003e5432   PROXIMUS-ISP-AS, BE\u003cp\u003e577    BACOM, CA\u003cp\u003eTo someone who doesn't know what ASNs are, they would probably assume they are addresses. This is not personal information, and there's no way to tie this information to any individual.\u003cp\u003eI opened a ticket and the only reply I get is that the ban will not be reversed and that the account will be deleted in 14 days. I've tried posting on Twitter and they have selectively ignored me while replying to everyone else. Any submission I make on the subreddit gets instantly deleted.\u003cp\u003eScreenshots for proof.\u003cp\u003ehttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/F49XZ4zaEAA_7mR?format=png\u0026name=small\u003cp\u003ehttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/F49XZ4zaEAErD3J?format=png\u0026name=small\u003cp\u003ehttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/F49XtAiaEAMmDdK?format=png\u0026name=900x900\u003cp\u003eThis also isn't the first issue we've had with Discord. They threatened to delete my server a few years ago because 1 person said they were underage amongst thousands of lines of chat and we did not see it and ban them. They refused to tell us who it was so I had to spend hours looking through chat to find the offending user.\u003cp\u003eThink twice before you decide to base your business around Discord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComments URL: \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37364605\"\u003ehttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37364605\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoints: 153\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e# Comments: 50\u003c/p\u003e\n","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37364605","external_url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37364605","date_published":"2023-09-02T19:18:55Z","author":{"name":"bottiger1","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bottiger1"}},{"id":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37364290","title":"I mirrored all the code from PyPI to GitHub and analysed it","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a side project I've been working on for the last few months.

Combined with direct queries to sqlite makes for a very snappy experience typically responding in less than 5ms. (Fingers crossed.)\u003cp\u003eThere are various places where XRss could be improved (PRs welcome!), but it already delivers on its purpose of demonstrating the plausibility of xtemplate.
