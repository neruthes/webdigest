That was exciting at the time because OpenAI's API calls were still quite expensive for GPT4, and the cost of running it on a book-length PDF would just be prohibitive. In contrast, you could run Llama2 locally on a machine with just a CPU, and it would be extremely slow, but \"free\" if you had a spare machine lying around.\u003cp\u003eWell, it's amazing how things have changed since then. Not only have models gotten a lot better, but the latest \"low tier\" offerings from OpenAI (GPT4o-mini) and Anthropic (Claude3-Haiku) are incredibly cheap and incredibly fast. So cheap and fast, in fact, that you can now break the document up into little chunks and submit them to the API concurrently (where each chunk can go through a multi-stage process, in which the output of the first stage is passed into another prompt for the next stage) and assemble it all in a shockingly short amount of time, and for basically a rounding error in terms of cost.\u003cp\u003eMy original project had all sorts of complex stuff for detecting hallucinations and incorrect, spurious additions to the text (like \"Here is the corrected text\" preambles). But the newer models are already good enough to eliminate most of that stuff. And you can get very impressive results with the multi-stage approach. In this case, the first pass asks it to correct OCR errors and to remove line breaks in the middle of a word and things like that. The next stage takes that as the input and asks the model to do things like reformat the text using markdown, to suppress page numbers and repeated page headers, etc. Anyway, I think the samples (which take less than 1-2 minutes to generate) show the power of the approach:\u003cp\u003eOriginal PDF:\n \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/llm_aided_ocr/blob/main/160301289-Warren-Buffett-Katharine-Graham-Letter.pdf\"\u003ehttps://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/llm_aided_ocr/blob/main...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eRaw OCR Output:\n \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/llm_aided_ocr/blob/main/160301289-Warren-Buffett-Katharine-Graham-Letter__raw_ocr_output.txt\"\u003ehttps://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/llm_aided_ocr/blob/main...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eLLM-Corrected Markdown Output:\n \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/llm_aided_ocr/blob/main/160301289-Warren-Buffett-Katharine-Graham-Letter_llm_corrected.md\"\u003ehttps://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/llm_aided_ocr/blob/main...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne interesting thing I found was that almost all my attempts to fix/improve things using \"classical\" methods like regex and other rule based things made everything worse and more brittle, and the real improvements came from adjusting the prompts to make things clearer for the model, and not asking the model to do too much in a single pass (like fixing OCR mistakes AND converting to markdown format).\u003cp\u003eAnyway, this project is very handy if you have some old scanned books you want to read from Archive.org or Google Books on a Kindle or other ereader device and want things to be re-flowable and clear. It's still not perfect, but I bet within the next year the models will improve even more that it will get closer to 100%.

HN: Stack Auth (YC S24) – An Open-Source Auth0/Clerk Alternative","content_html":"\n\u003cp\u003eHi HN! We're Zai and Konsti, and we're building Stack Auth (\u003ca href=\"https://stack-auth.com/\"\u003ehttps://stack-auth.com/\u003c/a\u003e), an open-source managed authentication and authorization platform. Basically, we build your login and signup pages, and everything that comes with that.\u003cp\u003eOur GitHub repo is at \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/stack-auth/stack\"\u003ehttps://github.com/stack-auth/stack\u003c/a\u003e, and there’s a zero-budget demo video here: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTkjdPf2E2Q\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTkjdPf2E2Q\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eStack Auth was born out of years of frustration with the incumbents. We wanted to build something that is developer-friendly and open-source at the same time.\u003cp\u003eThe dominant player in this space is Auth0, who appeals to enterprises but lags behind in developer-friendliness and has strong vendor lock-in. A newer one is Clerk, which markets directly to devs, but is still entirely proprietary. Open-source solutions like Supabase Auth or Auth.js/NextAuth are only authN, and don't provide the rest of the toolchain.\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, building your own auth infrastructure is tedious work. Rolling your own crypto is already hard enough, but on top you'll have to deal with OAuth flows, access tokens, RBAC, permission syncing, API keys, and so on. Most handcrafted OAuth or password-based applications in the wild are vulnerable in at least some of these areas.\u003cp\u003eTo us, the solution to this was obvious, so we decided to build it. Stack Auth is 100% open-source, licensed under MIT and AGPL. You can self-host, or choose to use our managed hosting. If you choose the latter, there's no lockin. You can export all your data and/or start self-hosting at any time.\u003cp\u003eAlso, we're more than just authentication — we have authorization (orgs, teams, permissions, RBAC) and user management (impersonation, user dashboard, webhooks).\u003cp\u003eOne interesting feature is what we call \"connected accounts\": we can manage and refresh your OAuth access tokens even for services that your users don't use for sign in, such as when accessing GMail or OneDrive APIs.\u003cp\u003eWe also put a lot of weight into integrating deeply into the tech stack itself. For now, we support Next.js frontends with a bunch of components and hooks for sign-in, password reset, and organizations. Though, we do have a well-documented REST API (\u003ca href=\"https://docs.stack-auth.com/rest-api/auth\"\u003ehttps://docs.stack-auth.com/rest-api/auth\u003c/a\u003e), so you can access Stack from any language.\u003cp\u003eFor more info, check out our GitHub repo above, or our documentation (\u003ca href=\"https://docs.stack-auth.com\"\u003ehttps://docs.stack-auth.com\u003c/a\u003e).\u003cp\u003eWould love to hear about your own stories and opinions on auth.
